OVER BLACK
We hear labored breathing.

QUOTE APPEARS:

                          "Revenge is a dish
                          best served cold"

                                         - Old Klingon Proverb -
QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;



                    MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Do you find me sadistic?

                                                       CUT TO:

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes
were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the
planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he

corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          I bet I could fry an egg on your
          head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
          now, you're aware enough to know
          there isn't a trace of sadism in
          my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
          these other jokers - bot not your.

OVERHEAD SHOT
We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.



                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
          at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

                                                    CUT TO:

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two
bullet holes in her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his girlfriend Janeen.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still
clutched in her dead fist.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's my best friend from work
          Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's the minister. I think his
          name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's his wife.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Organ player, don't know her name.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The

          name on his driver's license was
          Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
          some reason he preferred Arthur.
          Maybe if he went by Carles people
          would have called him Charlie. If
          that was his reason for going by
          Arthur I can understand it.
          Nothing wrong with the name
          Charlie, except he didn't look like
          a Charlie, he looked like an
          Arthur.
          Obviously you'll have to take my
          word on this. Speaking of names, I
          was about two seconds away from
          becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
          Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.



INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
          wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
          trying, I can tell you that.
          Actually Bill's last bullet put me
          in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
          for five years.
          When I woke up, ...I went on what
          the movie advertisements refer to
          as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
          roarded and I rampaged and I got
          bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
          killed 33 people to get to this
          piont right now.
          I have only one more.
          The last one.

          The one I'M driving to right now.
          The only one left.
          And when I arrive at my
          destination.....
          .... I'm gonna Kill Bill.


TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

                                           WE FADE TO BLACK



BLACK FRAME
TITLE APPEARS:


                        Chapter one

                            "2"


                                                    CUT TO:

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR
WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:


                        "The city of
                   PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"


We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.



EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.



INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.



                       FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
             Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.



                       THE HOUSEWIFE
             Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.



                        LITTLE GIRL
             Mommy, what happened to you and the
             T.V. Room?

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Oh, that good for nothin dog of
          yours, got his little ass in the
          living room and acted a damn fool,
          that's what happened.



                    LITTLE GIRL
          Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.



                    THE    HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, you    can't come in here,
          there's broken    glass all over the
          floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          This is a old friend of mommy's I
          ain't seen in a long time.



                     THE BRIDE
          Hello sweety, I'm *(BLEEP)*, what's
          your name?

* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know. *

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Her name is Nikki.



                     THE BRIDE
          Nikki. What a pretty name for such
          a pretty little girl. How old are
          you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Nikki, *(BLEEP)* aked you a
          question.



                    NIKKI
              (to The Bride)
          I'm four.



                       THE BRIDE
          Four years    old, aye. You know I
          once had a    little girl. She'd be
          five right    now. Maybe you two could
          of played    with each other.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Now baby, me an *(BLEEP)* have some
          grown-up talk to talk about, so you
          go in your room now and leave us
          alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
              (snapping her fingers)
          Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.



                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Want some coffee?



                    THE BRIDE
          Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.

                    THE HOUSEWIFE
          Cream and sugar?



                    THE BRIDE
          Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          This Pasadena homemaker's name is
          Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
          Lawrence Bell. But back when we
          were acquainted, five years ago,
          her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
          code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
          was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.



                    THE BRIDE
          Were you expecting me?



                    VERNITA
          Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
          me right after you woke up, and
          then again a little later after
          your episode in Japan.
              (pause)
          So I suppose it's a little late for
          a apology, huh?



                    THE BRIDE
          You suppose correctly.



                    VERNITA
          Even if I was sincere?



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh. I'm quite positive you're
          sorry, now.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

                    VERNITA
          Look bitch, I need to know if
          you're gonna start anymore shit
          around my baby girl!



                    THE BRIDE
          You can relax for now. I'm not
          going to murder you in front of
          your daughter.



                    VERNITA
          That's being more rational than
          Bill led me to believe you were
          capable of.



                    THE BRIDE
          Well that's a demonstration of
          Bill's complete ignorance when it
          comes to the subject of me, and
          what I'm thinking, and what I might
          do. It's mercy, compassion, and
          forgiveness I lack, not
          rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
          for long. I'll allow you to choose
          a time and place for us to meet
          again, preferably as far away from
          Nikki as possible.
          I could have just HIT you, I
          didn't, I demand respect for that.
          Since this is not a HIT, consider
          it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
          Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
          of honor. One on one - no help - no
          bushwhackin - no treacherous
          weapons - on weapon of choice - our
          skill and our bodies.

Vernita says her name;



                      VERNITA
          *(BLEEP)*

                    THE BRIDE
          - I'm not through telling you.
          Failure to keep our date, or
          duplicity of any kind, will result
          in me putting a xoxo hollow point
          bullet into the back of your skull
          from a window of a building across
          the street from Nikki's elementary
          school. Now, feel free to respond.



                    VERNITA
          Look...I know I fucked you over. I
          fucked you over bad. I wish to God
          I hadn't, but I did.

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.



                    VERNITA
          If I could go back in a machine I
          would, but I can't. All I can tell
          you is I'm a different person now.



                    THE BRIDE
          I don't care.



                    VERNITA
          Be that as it may, I know I do not
          deserve mercy or forgiveness.
          However, I beseech you for both on
          behalf of my daughter.



                    THE BRIDE
          -- Bitch, you can stop right there.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
well).



                    THE BRIDE
              (leans in close)
          Just because I have no wish to
          murder you before the eyes of your
          daughter, does not mean parading
          her around in front of me is going
          to inspire sympathy. You and I have
          unfinished business.

          And not    a goddamn fuckin thing
          you've    done in the subsequent five
          years -    including getting knocked
          up - is    going to change that.



                    VERNITA
          You have every right to wanna get
          even --



                    THE BRIDE
          -- But that's where you're wrong,
          Vernita. I don't want to get even.
          To get even, even Steven. I would
          have to kill you, go into Nikki's
          room, kill her, then wait for your
          old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
          kill him. That would make us even.
          No, my unborn daughter will just
          hafta be satisfied with your death
          at her mother's hands.

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.



                    VERNITA
          When do we do this?



                     THE BRIDE
          It all depends... When do you want
          to die? Tomorrow? The day after
          tomorrow? That's about as long as
          I'll wait.



                    VERNITA
          How bout tonight, bitch?



                    THE BRIDE
          Spendid. Where?



                    VERNITA
          There's a baseball diamond where
          our little league has its games,
          about a mile from here. We meet
          there around two-thirty in the
          morning, dressed all in black, your
          hair in a black stocking, and we
          have us a knife fight, we won't be

          bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
          cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.



                    THE BRIDE
          Bill said you were one of the best
          ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
          weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."



                    VERNITA
          Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
          qualify it, so you can just kiss my
          motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
              (snorts to herself)
          Black Mamba, I shoulda been
          motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.



                    THE BRIDE
          Weapon of choice? And if you want
          to stick with your butcher knife,
          I'm cool with that.



                    VERNITA
          Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.



                       VERNITA
             Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
             don't...



                        THE BRIDE
             Do to your daughter, what you did
             to mine...
                 (she takes her hand)
             ...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her    blade.



                       THE BRIDE
             It was not my intention to do this
             in front of you. For that I'm
             sorry. But you can take my word for
             it, your mother had it coming. When
             you grow up, if you still feel raw
             about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.



EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;


                        DEATH LIST FIVE

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;


                         VERNITA GREEN
                             COBRA

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

INT. THE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Bride, alone in her bed, alone in her coma, alone in her
room.

Elle Driver opens the door to her room and steps inside.
The female assassin approaches the comatose woman.

EX CU ELLE DRIVER'S EYE AND WHITE EYE PATCH
looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and
opposite number.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES
wide open - blank stare.

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;



                    ELLE
          I might never of liked you. Point
          in fact I despise you. But that
          doesn't suggest I don't respect
          you. You were a master of a
          profession that's most difficult to
          master.
          Dying in our sleep is a luxury our
          kind is rarely afforded. My gift to
          you.

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the
other end....she answers it.



                    ELLE
          Hello, Bill.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          Comatose.
              (pause)
          I'm standing over her right now.
              (pause)
          What!

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of
The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell
phone.



                    ELLE
          Don't fuckin ssshhh me! If you
          think I came all the way down to
          Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm
          no less - just to tuck sleeping
          beauty in bed - you got another
          fuckin thing comin -
              (pause, then real loud)
          You don't owe her Shit!!
              (then again, but quieter)
          You don't owe her shit.
              (pause)
          Man, fuck that bitch!
              (pause)
          Oh you're not are you? Well Bill,
          you never leave a job half done.
          A great teacher taught me that
          once, he looked a whole lot like

          you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;



                    ELLE
          I guess.
              (pause)
          No, I don't need to guess, I know.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.



                    ELLE
          Thought that was pretty funny
          didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
          don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.



                    ELLE
          Ya know now I get a better look at
          you, you're not so damn pretty.
          Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
          for you but...ya know, now I get a
          closer look at you you're kinda
          weird looking. You got this big
          nose that doesn't fit with the rest
          of your face, your eyes are two
          different sizes. And look at your
          skin...My complexion is way better
          than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.



                    ELLE
          Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.



                    ELLE
          If you ever take your ass out of
          this Goddamn bed for as long as you
          fuckin live, I will beat you into
          the ground, bitch!



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the
hallway. She passes by a DOCTOR, STRUGGLING WITH A PATIENT
BLEEDING PROFUSELY on a gurney.



                    DOCTOR
              (yelling)
          Nurse come here quick, we're losing

Elle doesn't even look back.

She walks out of the SHOT.

and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood.

The BUZZING stops....

QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,
BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;



                      THE BRIDE
          My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the
lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;

She counts again.

              (a statement)
          Five years.

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby
is long gone.

WHEN SUDDENLY...

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING
TOWARDS HER ROOM....

WE SEE THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF A COMIC BOOK THOUGHT
BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL'S BLACK BOOTS
walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT

                                       two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;


       BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY
      (in time)                              (in time)
   She's right in here.                She's right in here.


                      SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
                   STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Now is that the cutest little
          blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
          that the cutest little blonde
          pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)
fronts.



                    WARREN
          I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."



                    THE ORDERLY
          Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
          know damn well this is the best
          pussy you ever saw you had touchin
          rights to. The price is seventy
          five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
          gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;



                    THE ORDERLY
          Here's the rules; Rule    number one;
          no punchin 'er.
          Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got
          'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,
          jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches
          under no circumstances.    And by the

          way, this little cunt's a spitter -
          it's a motor reflex thing but spit
          or no, no punchin. Now are we
          absolutely positively clear about
          rule number one?



                    TWO TRUCKERS
          Yeah.



                    THE ORDERLY
          Rule number two;
          No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
          fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
          But after that, it's allll goooood.
          Her plummin down there don't work
          no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
          all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
          try not to make a mess, and I'll be
          back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.



                     THE ORDERLY
          Oh by the way, not all the time,
          but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
          get drier than a bucket of sand.
          If she dry, lube up with this and
          you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
          gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
BLINKS.



                    GERALD
          Hey Warren, she just blinked.



                    WARREN
          He said she can't blink.



                    GERALD
          I know what he said, I'm tellin ya

          she just did.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.



                    WARREN
          Just wait, when I get through with
          this little dumbbell, she gonna
          stand up and recite the Gettysburg
          Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.



                    WARREN
          Hey, Gerald.



                    GERALD
          Yeah?



                    WARREN
          This shit ain't no peep show. Go
          out in the hall and I'll let ya
          know when it's your turn.



                    GERALD
          Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room?



                    WARREN
          I can't get no errection wit you
          lookin at me, so go on.



                    GERALD
          Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.



INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

                    GERALD
          He man, keep it down in there, I
          can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.



INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.



                       ORDERLY
          Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT
The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

                                 SLAM!

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
FRAME.

The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where's Bill?



                       THE ORDERLY
                 (hurt and confused)
          Who?

                                 SLAM!

He screams.

                    THE BRIDE
          Bill! Where is Bill!



                    THE ORDERLY
          I dunno no Bill.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          I saw him here myself.....
              SLAM!
          ....Now do you tell me where he is,
          or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

                           SLAM!



                    THE ORDERLY
          Please please stop, don't hit me
          again!



                    THE BRIDE
          Where is Bill?

                           SLAM!

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.



                    THE BRIDE
          Where did you get this from?



                    THE ORDERLY
          That's mine.

                           SLAM!



                    THE BRIDE
          Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in
          this room ten minutes ago.

                           SLAM!

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of

his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.



                       BUCK
             Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
             pie they all said you wuz. Well
             Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
             name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;



                       THE BRIDE
             Your name's Buck, right? And you
             came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly
uniform.



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.



INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.



                    THE BRIDE
              (monotone)
          Wiggle your big toe.

Toe doesn't move an inch.



                    THE BRIDE
          Wiggle your big toe.

It doesn't move.

                          THE BRIDE
                Wiggle your big toe.
                    (VOICE OVER)
                As I lay in the back of Buck's
                pickup truck, trying to will my
                limbs out of entropy, I could see
                the faces of the cunts who did this
                to me, and the dick responsible.
                Members all of Bill's brainchild;
                "The Deadly Viper Assassination
                Squad."

WE MOVE INTO A HEAD and SHOULDERS CU OF The BRIDE'S BLACK
SILHOUETTE.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          Now after five years of beauty
          sleep I knew absolutely nothing
          about my enemies' strengths
          weakness or whereabouts. But as
          fated by God vengeance would have
          it, I who knew nothing - knew one
          thing. As sure as God made little
          green apples...

WE MOVE FAST TO O-REN ISHII'S SILHOUETTE, The SILHOUETTE
BECOMES A POSED PICTURE OF O-REN in all her Deadly Viper
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
              (continued)
          ....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name
          on my Death List, was still
          alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren
          Ishii, made her first acquaintance
          with death at the age of eleven.

FLASH ON
CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the
American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one
with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with
samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they
finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and
face of a stone.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
             half-Japanese American Army brat
             witnessed the murder of her Master
             Sergeant father. And the rape, then
             murder of her mother at the hands
             of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza
             boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
             revenge...luckily for her, Boss
             Matsumoto was a pedophile.

SHOCK CUT
O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS
CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl
uniform.



                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             At thirteen, she got her revenge.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the
room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun
from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her
eye. Her EYE is HUGELY MAGNIFIED in the SCOPE.



                       THE BRIDE
             By twenty, she was one of the tip
             top of female assassins in the
             world.

She fires.



INT. CAR - DAY

A Central American General riding backseat    of his government
vehicle. TWO BEAUTIFUL LATIN WOMEN in one-   piece bathing suits
sit on either side of him. They both wear    sashes down their
front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other    reads, "Miss
Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each
of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is
BLOWN OFF.

The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly
viewed.)



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At twenty-three she joined Bill's
          Deadly Vipers...

The 25-YEAR-OLD O-REN ISHII
BEATING UP the pregnant Bride with the other Vipers...



                     THE BRIDE (V.O.)

          the killing of eight innocent
          people, including my unborn
          daughter, in a small wedding chapel
          in El Paso Texas. But on that day,
          five years ago, she made one big
          mistake...

POSED FIGURE of the BRIDE in all her pre-beating bridal gown
glory.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)

FADE UP ON



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Pavement of the parking lot. We HEAR a CAR DOOR OPEN
OFFSCREEN, then The Bride's bare foot comes from above FRAME,
stepping down INTO The SHOT.

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the
dash. She puts them on.



EXT. TEXAS STREETS/ INT. TEXAS STORES - DAY

The Bride drives Buck's big, yellow pussy wagon all over El
Paso buying supplies.

WE FOLLOW Her bare feet into a clothing store.

Her feet, legs, and ass slip into a new pair of LEVI'S.

Her hands grab a pair of CHERRY BROWN COWBOY BOOTS.

Then slips on the cowboy boots.

Chooses another TOP.

And finds a warm JACKET.

She opens Buck's "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN" wallet, and pays for
the items.

She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs
back in the truck.

She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking
inside.

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING
FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch

of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll
CROSSCUT....

....with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low-rent motel
called, "The Texican"....

...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk,
getting the key, and paying him out of the "BIG EL PASO
PIMPIN" wallet....

...her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room...

Shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store...

...conditioner...

...a bar of soap...

...hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet...

...steam rises off the hot bathwater...

...she pulls down a bunch of bath products, like bubble bath,
salts, apricot this - kiwi that, we see her pour all the
items in the bathwater...

...then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater...

...then Lower her whole body into the bathwater...

...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect
MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart
has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out
of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,
who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her
path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while
incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the
undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution
that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm
water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE
DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other
side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin
shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has
closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the
yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,
and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to
follow.

EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.



EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

2 9mm AUTOMATICS, w/ AMMO
and HOLSTERS.

She flips it open, and inside broken down into four separate
pieces is a HIGH-POWERED, SCOPE-SIGHT RIFLE.

1 MANILA ENVELOPE.
She reaches in and pulls out a PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM.
There on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl. A
fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram
back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in
the locker she pulls out the final item,

1 SMALL KEY attached to a "DEALY VIPERS" KEY CHAIN.

She rolls up the weapons in the sleeping bag, and drives off.
The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES...

                           "The Undisputed Truth."

AS The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES...WE see The BRIDE leaving the
bank, all the weapons she needs, all the money she needs,
taking the first step on her bloody trail...

A RINKY DINK GRAPHIC OF A MAP OF JAPAN

The tiny figure of a black AIRPLANE flies over the map,
leaving a dotted-line trail behind it. We move into the black

airplane and DISSOLVE to

INT. SUSHI BAR (OKINAWA, JAPAN) - DAY

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese
curtain....

SUBTITLE APPEARS:


                           "The City of
                         OKINAWA, JAPAN"

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,
and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word
cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The
SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          English?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Almost -- American.



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Ahhhh,...America, welcome...
          Welcome... My English -- Very good.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She
doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest
assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,
American tourist.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and
says;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,
          you speak Japanese?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Nooo, just a few words I learned
          since yesterday. - May I sit at the
          bar?



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Sure sure sure - sit. What other
          words did you learn - excuse me --

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to
imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling
to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          -- What other Japanese you learn?

The Bride puts on a thinking face.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Oh...let's see..."Arigato."



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          "Arigato"...Very good.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          ..."Ah-So"...



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          "Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So"
          means



                     THE BRIDE
          "I See."



                    SUSHI CHEF
          I see - Very good.



                    THE BRIDE
          I already said "Domo", right?



                     SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-netie-wa."

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          ..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          "Kon-nichi-wa?"

Saying with surprise and admiration;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Most impressive...you say Japanese
          words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

                    THE BRIDE
          Now you're making fun of me.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          No no no - serious business.
          Pronunciation - very good. You say
          "Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You should learn Japanese - very
          easy.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          No kidding, I heard it's kinda
          hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I always heard it was difficult.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
          you have Japanese tongue.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Maybe I was Japanese in another
          life.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Most definitely, most definitely
             Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             How did you know tuna's my
             favorite?



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             What!



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Tuna's my favorite.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
                 (to the bald man)
             I beg your pardon?

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.



                         SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             - Drink -



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
             Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.



                        SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
             Ahhh sake,
                 (he holds up his thumb)
             Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          First time in Japan?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          A-huh.



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What!



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Yes, this is my first time.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          What brings you to Okinawa?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I came to see a man.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Aaahh, you have friend live in
          Okinawa?



                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Not quite.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          Not friend?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I've never met him.

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....



                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

          Who is he, may I ask?



                    THE BRIDE
          Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          What do you want with Hattori
          Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I need Japanese steel.



                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
          Why do you need Japanese steel?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I have vermin to kill.



                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
          You must have big rats you need
          Hattori Hanzo steel.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Huge.



INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...try the second one down in the
          sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          ...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I wanted to show you these....
          However someone as you, who knows
          so much must surely know, I no
          longer make instruments of death. I
          keep these here for their ascetic
          and sentimental value.
              (he takes both sword and
               sheath from her...)
          Yet proud tho I am of my life's
          work...
              (...he closes them
               together)
          I am retired.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Then give me one of these.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          These are not for sale.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I didn't say, sell me. I said, give
          me.



                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
          And why should I be obliged to
          assist you in the extermination of
          your vermin?



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Because my vermin, is a former
          student of yours. And considering
          the student, I'd say you had a
          rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...You can sleep there...

.....starts to descend....



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...it will take me a week to make
          the sword...

.....before his head disappears, he says;



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          ...I suggest you spend it
          practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.



OVER BLACK
TITLE APPEARS:


                        "One week later"

Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo's voice in Japanese and
read the subtitles;



                    HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
          I'm done doing what I swore an oath
          to God 28 years ago to never do
          again. I've created, "something
          that kills people." And in that
          purpose I was a success.

                                                FADE UP ON



CU HATTORI HANZO



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          I've done this, because
          philosophically I'm sympathetic to
          your aim.

EX CU The HANZO SWORD

TRACKING EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny, black wood
sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved
the face of a lioness...



                      HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
            I can tell you with no ego, this is
            my finest sword. If on your
            journey, you should encounter God,
            God will be cut.

CU HANZO.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            Revenge is never a straight line.
            It's a forest. And like a forest
            it's easy to lose your way...to get
            lost...
            to forget where you came in. To
            serve as a compass, a combat
            philosophy must be adopted that can
            be found in the secret doctrine of
            the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow
            haired warrior, repeat after me;

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the
doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride
repeating it.



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            "When engaged in combat, the
            vanquishing of thine enemy can be
            the warrior's only concern...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...This is the first and cardinal
            rule of combat...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)
            ...Suppress all human emotion and
            compassion...

The Bride repeats this...



                      HANZO (JAPANESE)

          ...Kill whoever stands in thy way,
          even if that be Lord God, or Buddha
          himself...

The Bride repeats this...



                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
          This truth lies at the heart of the
          art of combat. Once it is
          mastered... Thou shall fear no
          one... Though the devil himself may
          bar thy way...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker
of swords on this earth and says;



                       THE BRIDE
          Domo.

EX CU The Hanzo Sword,
her white hand with her long fingers COMES INTO FRAME and
removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance.

                                              FADE TO BLACK.

                           Chapter Four

                             SHOWDOWN
                                at
                       HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES


                                                     CUT TO:

A BLANK PIECE    OF DRAWING PAPER
A hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image,
draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha
regaled O-REN    ISHII.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When fortune smiles on something as
          violent and ugly as revenge, at the
          time it seems proof like no other,
          that not only does God exist,
          you're doing his will. At a time
          when I knew the last about my
          enemies, the first name on my death
          list, was the easiest to find. But

          of course,    when one manages the
          difficult    task of becoming queen of
          the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't
          keep it a    secret, does one?

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning
into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          At the age of twenty, Bill backed
          his Nippon progeny financially and
          philosophically in her
          Shakespearian-in-magnitude power
          struggle with the other Yakuza
          clans, over who would rule vice in
          the city of Tokyo.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER
YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the
real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          When it was all over, it was the
          geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that
          proved the victor.



INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the
city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO
BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with
much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          And just in case you're wondering
          how could a half breed Japanese
          Chinese American become the boss of
          all criminal activity in Tokyo,
          Japan,... I'll tell you. The
          subject of O-Ren's blood and
          nationality came up before the
          council only once. The night O-Ren
          assumed power over the crime
          council.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the
alcohol-fueled frivolity.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The man who seems bound and
          determined to break the mood is
          Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka
          thinks is...

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the
plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the
Tanaka Crime Family.



                    CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE)
          Tanaka? What's the meaning of this
          outburst? This is a time for
          celebration.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          And what exactly should I be
          celebrating? The perversion of our
          illustrious council?

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains
cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it
for the rest of the sentence.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously
          has something on his mind. Allow
          him to express it.



                    BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
          My father...
              (looking at a clan head)
          ...along with yours and...
              (looking at another)
          ...along With yours, started this
          council. And while you drink like
          fish and laugh like donkeys, they
          weep in the afterlife over the
          perversion committed today.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

           Silence!
               (then composed)
           Of what perversion do you speak,
           Tanaka?

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;



                     BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
           I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
           perversion done to this council,
           which I love more than my own
           children,...by making a half
           Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Drop them on the ground.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get behind me.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Get on your knees.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
           Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.



                     O-REN
           I'm going to say this in English so
           you know how serious I am. As your
           leader, I encourage you to -- from
           time to time and always in a
           respectful manner, and with the
           complete knowledge that my decision
           is final -- to question my logic.
           If you're unconvinced a particular
           plan of action I've decided is the
           wisest, tell me so. But allow me to
           convince you. And I will promise
           you, right here and now, no subject
           will be taboo...except the subject
           that was just under discussion.



                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
               (to a bodyguard)
           Hand me that head.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)

          The price you pay for bringing up
          either my Chinese or my American
          heritage as a negative is, I
          collect your fuckin head.
              (now completely American)
          Just like this fucker here. Now if
          any of you sonsabitches got
          anything else to say, now's the
          fuckin time.

Nobody says anything.



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          I didn't think so.
              (pause)
          Meeting adjourned.



EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.



INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          The mop tops in black suits and
          Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
          "The Crazy 88." The two young girls
          in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
          personal bodyguards, the Yubari
          sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
          Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
          who's dressed like she's a villain
          on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
          and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
          finally, the American in the black
          suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
          head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.



INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

                                                 END OF SHOT
BACK AND FORTH
between CU's of the two women, face to face.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
               (to Bride)
           Can I help you?



                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
           Yes, I am looking for the attorney
           of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
           that be you?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
           I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
           can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.



INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale

of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
          O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
          unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO
take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN
seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

          You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.


                          The Bride
                             vs.
                         The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
          we're going to have to close the
          place. There's some private
          business that we must attend to
          now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;



                    O-REN
          Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.



                    MIKI (JAPANESE)
          You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT
Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN
standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN
smiles.



                     O   -REN (ENGLISH)
              (to the     Bride)
          You didn't     think it was going to be
          that easy,     did you?

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
              (to O-Ren)
          You know, for a second there, yeah
          I did.

O-Ren smiles...



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...



                    O-REN/THE BRIDE
          ...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to

collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN
WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

GO GO
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Those    of you lucky enough to still
          have    your lives. Take them with
          you.    But leave the limbs you've
          lost.    They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN
in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO
smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty
looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her
flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Any more subordinates for me to
          kill, O-Ren?

Mr. Barrel says;



                    MR. BARREL
          One last one.



                    THE BRIDE
          You're Mr. Barrel, right?



                    MR. BARREL
          And you're Black Mamba.



                    THE BRIDE
          Our reputations precede us.



                    MR. BARREL
          Apparently.

                    THE BRIDE
          Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you
          wear your Kato mask? Are you and
          iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.



                    MR. BARREL
          I don't like that rubber band. It
          fucks up my hair.



                    THE BRIDE
          You shouldn't work for her.



                      MR. BARREL
          Too late.



                    THE BRIDE
          It's not too late to quit.



                    MR. BARREL
          Do you have choices?



                      THE BRIDE
          No.



                    MR. BARREL
          I know exactly how you feel.



                    THE BRIDE
          This has nothing to do with You and
          I, and everything to do with me
          taking satisfaction from that bitch
          behind you. And there's absolutely
          positively no way I'M going to
          leave here without taking that
          satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you
          have to stand aside. And that means
          you must quit, right now.

                     MR. BARREL
          I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Yes you can.



                    MR. BARREL
          No I can't.



                    THE BRIDE
          Don't say "Can't", there are no
          "Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN ISHII
Screams at her "...last line of defense;"



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          What are you waiting for? Are you
          on a date? Attack her you fool!



                    THE BRIDE
          Oh my God...
              (pause)
          ...She just called you a fool. She
          just called you a fool in front of
          me. Not only am I your opponent.
          I'm a female fellow countryman.
          And you're going to risk your life -
          to say nothing of harming me - for
          a woman who refers to you as a
          fool?

O-REN
is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Attack, Goddamn you!

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;



                      MR. BARREL
            The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;



                      MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
            I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left
hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn
room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel
with   the Bride, He stops and    says;



                      MR. BARREL
            About that one you owe me.



                      THE BRIDE
            Yes?



                      MR. BARREL
            I'm gonna collect someday, you
            know?



                      THE BRIDE
            I'll be disappointed if you don't.

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

                    MR. BARREL
          Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Very funny.
              (pause)
          Your instrument is quite
          impressive.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Domo.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Where was it made?



                      THE BRIDE
          Okinawa.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Whom in Okinawa made you this
          steel?



                    THE BRIDE
          This is Hattori Hanzo steel.



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          YOU LIE!!

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Swords however never get tired. I
          hope you've saved your energy. If
          you haven't, you might not last
          five minutes.
              (pause)

          Have you seen the garden in this
          establishment?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          No.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Oh, you really should. It's quite
          beautiful. Allow me.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          As last looks go, you could do
          worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...



INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

O-REN'S FEET
White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN
when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;



                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
          Silly Caucasian girl likes to play
          with samurai swords. Bill might of
          humored you, but you will find
          neither humor nor mercy at my
          blade. Now unless you intend to
          commit sepeku among the koi, stand
          up and fight. You may not be able
          to fight like a samurai, but you
          can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Attack me. With everything you
          have.

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with

The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.



                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
          I apologize for ridiculing you
          earlier.



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Accepted.

They continue breathing...



                      THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Ready?



                      O-REN (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in
the white snow.

CU O-REN ISHII
facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           That really was a Hattori Hanzo
           sword...

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           I always dreamed of owning one...

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           Did he make it for you?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
           Yes.

The Last thing she says before she dies;



                     O-REN (ENGLISH)
           ...He must of liked you.

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

EX CU THE HANZO SWORD

is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo
carved into the wood seems pleased.

                                                  CUT TO:

The BRIDE
now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her
head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK...

The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed.

The BRIDE

BLACK SCREEN
The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the
TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly
Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of
the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically
spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I've kept you alive for one reason.
          Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,
          I take it you're familiar with
          Bill?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          In fact, I'd guesstimate, you
          worked for Bill before O-Ren, and
          that's how it is you came to work
          for O-Ren. Am I correct?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I thought so. Give me the arm you
          have left.



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Why?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I want information. Now gimme your
          arm.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          The cocktail racing    through your
          bloodstream at this    moment is
          Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The
          Undisputed Truth."

Sofie is injected.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, first things first. Where was
          the other Yubari sister? Yuki?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki's sick. She went home early.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Do tell? What's wrong with her?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She has a cold.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Awwww poor baby. What do you think
          she'll do when she finds out what
          happened?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)

          She'll wail with grief.

                                               SHOCK CUT TO

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll drink excessively.

BACK TO YUKI
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE
          She'll start trouble.

BACK TO YUKI
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in
a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the
make on her.



                    BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Do you like Ferraris?

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ferrari...Italian trash.

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the
business suit.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Do you find me hot?

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she
gets annoyed;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck
          me, yes or no?

                       BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
          Yes.

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short
sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,
creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up
more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How bout now, big boy, do you still
          wish to penetrate me...

Blade cuts deeper...



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Or is it I who has penetrated you.

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice
that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          When she stops shedding tears,
          she'll start shedding blood.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Best guess, what will she do?



                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          I don't hafta guess, she'll come
          after you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Will she ever give up?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          She won't have to. When she finds

          you, I don't know who will win. But
          what I do know is, she will find
          you.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Is she more skilled than I?



                    SOFIE (JAPANESE)
          Skilled won't be the word.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't be coy with me, bitch. What
          would be the word?



                    SOFIE
          Crazy.

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Okay, now I want all the
          information on the Deadly
          Vipers,... What they've been doing
          and where I can find them.



EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

                                                 CUT TO:

CU SOFIE
in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF
SCREEN;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so
          sorry.

                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Please forgive my betrayal --

He shhhh's her off screen;



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- no more of that. I invented that
          truth serum. Once it entered your
          bloodstream, you no longer had a
          choice.



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          But, still --



                    BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
          -- But still -- nothing, except my
          aching heart over what she's done
          to my beautiful and brilliant
          Sofie.
              (pause)
          If you had to guess why she left
          you alive, what would be your
          guess?



                    SOFIE (ENGLISH)
          Guessing won't be necessary. She
          informed me.

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          I'm allowing you to keep your
          wicked life for one reason and one
          reason only. So you can tell him,
          in person, everything that happened
          here tonight. I want him to witness
          the extent of my mercy..., by
          witnessing your deformed body. I
          want you to tell him, all the
          information you just told me. I
          want him to know what I know. I
          want him to know I want him to
          know.

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to
the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          And I want them all to know,
          they'll all soon be as dead as O
          REN.

          If O-Ren was number one, unless
          she's being tricky, Vernita Green
          will be number two.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Where is Vernita Green?



                    BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)

          But the woman you want will hold up
          in a low budget motel, fifteen of
          twenty minutes away from stepping
          on board a plane departing LAX. If
          I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in
English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          California, here I come.

We see YUKI dressed in her Japanese private schoolgirl outfit
with white blouse, plaid skirt, bobby socks, blazer, and
barrettes in her hair, flying on a jet enroute to Los
Angeles. She paints her fingernails with bubble gum-colored
nail polish.

Yuki walks through LAX.

We see her cool convertible sports car and her finger
pointing at it.

We see Yuki behind the wheel of the sports car, driving as
fast as she can through the twists and turns of the Hollywood
Hills, laughing all the way.

We see Yuki running around all over LA, Hollywood and
Disneyland taking pictures with her disposable Barbie camera.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just
about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Conigute wa!

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I was.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You still are. One way.

                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          I know you feel you must avenge
          your sister. But I beg you...walk
          away.

Yuki giggles.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You call that begging? You can beg
          better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Can I see your    face? I've heard
          your beauty is    exquisite. I would
          like to see for    myself.



                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
          is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.



                    THE BRIDE
          Domo.



                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
          Your face is so    pretty, I just want
          to put both of    my palms against
          your cheeks and    give you little
          tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          How do I look?



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

          Very pretty.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You're just saying that 'cause I
          told you how pretty you are.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, you're gorgeous.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Really? Is that how you'd describe
          me to somebody if I wasn't here?
          Yuki's gorgeous?



                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
          You bet.

Yuki giggles.



                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
          Don't make me kill you.



                     YUKI (ENGLISH)
          Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;



                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
          You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.

The Bride yells at them;



                     THE BRIDE
          Stay in your house and stay down on
          the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Time for the rabbit to come out of
          her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.



                    THE BRIDE
              (to herself)
          Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          You fucking bitch! You shot me in
          my breast! They're not fully
          developed yet, you fucking asshole!
          Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;



                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
          Yuki, in about two    minutes there's
          going to be an army    of police here.
          So if you're gonna    kill me, now's
          the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.



                    THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
          So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.



                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
          That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the

Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.



                       THE BRIDE
             Goddamn, what a wildcat.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.



                       NURSE OWENS
             Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.



                       THE BRIDE
             Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --



                       NURSE OWENS
             Who is this.



                       THE BRIDE
             You don't know me, but --



                       NURSE OWENS
             -- And I don't want to neither. Now

I don't know how you got my number,
but you can just rip that shit up,
because --



          THE BRIDE
-- I've been shot five times --



          NURSE OWENS
-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no
more. I got problems of my own.



             THE BRIDE
I'm dying.



          NURSE OWENS
Then bitch, you better call
yourself a ambulance, cause I don't
do this shit no more.



          THE BRIDE
I can't call an ambulance.



             NURSE OWENS
--    No, you can call a ambulance,
you    just don't want to. But if your
ass    is really dying, you ain't got
no    motherfuckin choice.



          THE BRIDE
I do have a choice, and I'm
choosing to call you. If you refuse
to help me, I'll die. And that will
be your choice.



          NURSE OWENS
Bitch, I don't even know you!



          THE BRIDE
What do you need to know? I'm from
Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and
only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, where you at?



                    THE BRIDE
          I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a
          kids treehouse. It's a street
          called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
          Avenue. There's a bunch of police
          cars and firetrucks, about two
          blocks away.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?



                    THE BRIDE
          If you can't walk, you better
          crawl.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You got you some money dontcha, or
          am I doin this out of the goodness
          of my heart?



                    THE BRIDE
          You come and get me, today's pay
          day.



                    NURSE OWENS
          You ain't too far away. You gonna
          bleed to death I get there in a
          half a hour?



                      THE BRIDE
          Probably.



                    NURSE OWENS
          Okay, I'll be there in fifteen
          minutes.

                    THE BRIDE
          Is that Pacific Standard Time, or
          C.P.T.?



                    NURSE OWENS
          Just you better be there    when I get
          there, and you better be    shot five
          times, and your bony ass    better be
          on your last motherfuckin    legs.



                    THE BRIDE
          How do you know I have a bony ass?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You sound like you have a bony ass.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.



INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.



                    THE BRIDE
          Glad you made it.



                    NURSE OWENS
          There's cops all over here, I had
          to be cool. They tend to notice
          things like Negroes sneaking around
          people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.



                    THE BRIDE
          What's that?



                    NURSE OWENS
          This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't
          got no anesthetic.

              (refers to the bottle)
          So git busy.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT
The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;



                    THE BRIDE
          That fuckin smarts.

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;



                    NURSE OWENS
          Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
          future, you should avoid them if
          you can.



                    THE BRIDE
          I'll keep that in mind. So, do I
          have a future?



                    NURSE OWENS
          You'll live to kill again.



                      THE BRIDE
          Splendid.

She passes out.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK FRAME
TITLE CARD:


                          Chapter six

                 "Can she bake a cherry pie."


EX CU SLOT IN DOOR
is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Yes?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          I heard you had a game?



                    DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Who are you?



                    TWO EYES (O.S.)
          They call me Bill.



                       DOORMAN (O.S.)
          Bill what?



                    BILL (O.S.)
          That, no one ever calls me.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;



                    FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Open the door Alburt, let's see
          what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.



                       L.F. O'BOYLE
             Are you a policeman, Bill?



                       BILL
             Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.



                       L.F.
             Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



                       L.F.
                 (to the players)
             We now return to the game already
             in progress. The point is nine
             gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



                       ALBURT
             I'll take that.



                       BILL
             You'll have to.

The two men stare...



                       L.F.
             Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
             intend to start any shit with that
             sword?



                       BILL
             I give you my word of honor, I will
             start nothing.

                    L.F.
          Good enough for me.
              (back to game)



                    ALBURT
          Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
          dollar membership fee.



                    BILL
          That's rather pricey.



                    ALBURT
          You wanna play for free, go to
          Vegas. You start now you'll be
          there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



                    BILL
          I think I'll stay here. I'm
          thirsty.



                      ALBURT
          That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



                      BILL
          Beer.



                    BARTENDER
          Twenty dollars.



                    BILL
          Twenty dollars for a beer?



                    BARTENDER
          High cost of living shooter. You
          don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

          get a prime rib dinner there for
          3.95.



                    BILL
          What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.
              (throws a 20 on the bar)
          Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



                    BILL
              (pointing to the can)
          I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



                    BILL
          Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.



                    L.F.
          Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid
          in school wants    to play right away.
              (to Bill)
          How bout it new    kid, you wanna
          handle my bones,    or do you just
          like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...



                    BILL
          I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.



                    L.F.
          Boys take a look at this man, he's
          what Webster's calls, a gambler.
          The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

                    L.F.
          I hope you're not implying
          anything, friend?



                    BILL
              (as he inspects dice)
          I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.



                    ALBURT
          That did it fuckhead, you're out
          the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.



                    BILL
          You looked me over when I stood in
          your doorway. I'm looking you over
          as I step up to your table. If I
          don't know, I don't throw.



                    L.F.
          Are you satisfied?



                    BILL
          More or less.



                    L.F.
          I think we're getting into a
          antagonistic relationship.



                    BILL
          Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
          trying to take my money, and I was
          trying to take yours.

                    L.F.
          It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.



                     BILL
          If you're game, take my bet
          sportsman.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.

The room reacts.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...



                    L.F.
          The point is five, gentlemen, five
          is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;



                    BILL
          Shoot it all.



                    L.F.
          Pretty lucky tonight, huh?



                    BILL
          Play a game of luck long enough
          you're bound to meet some lucky
          people.



                    L.F.
          You know we've never been properly
          introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.



                    BILL
          And I'm not interested.



                    L.F.
          No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
          boy, I'm only trying to be
          friendly.



                    BILL
          I didn't come here to make friends.
          I came here to shoot a little crap.
          But then your boy over there hits
          me up for a two hundred dollar
          privilege to play fee --



                    L.F.
          -- That's a membership fee, good
          for --



                    BILL

-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.



          L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?



             BILL
I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm
through    with you,    you won't have a
pot to    piss, or a    window to throw
it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out
of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.



          L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.



          BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



          L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.



             BILL

          Oooohhh, that's....



                    L.F.
          The house's perogative and you know
          it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



                    L.F.
          Maybe you would like to change your
          bet?



                    BILL
          Yes I would.....Shoot it
          all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.



                     L.F.
          What?



                    BILL
          Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
          I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;



                    ALBURT
          You can't do that.



                    BILL
          Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
          perogative, and she knows it.



                     L.F.
          Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



                    BILL
          Can I use your phone?



                    L.F.
          Sure it's next to the bed.



INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.



                    L.F.
          Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
          out! No more tonight, go home....



                    BILL
              (into phone)
          Vernita's dead? When?
              (pause)
          What about her family?
              (pause)
          Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
          completely apeshit. No idea where
          she is?
              (pause)
          Okay that did it, we're going to
          Texas and talk sense into Budd
          before (BLEEP) makes him number
          three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



                    BILL
          We're going to have a talk about
          this later.
              (pause)

          Well, I'm not exactly among friends
          at the moment.
              (pause...he laughs)
          I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



                    BILL
          Got a nose problem?



                    L.F.
          I said you could use my phone. I
          didn't say I wouldn't listen.



                    BILL
          This is true.



                    L.F.
          You didn't burn me down you know?



                     BILL
          Course not. First rule of any
          house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
          comes in and wipes the place out
          insurance.



                     L.F.
          If there weren't losers it wouldn't
          be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



                    BILL
          I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
             What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
             the real game was just beginning.
             Bill was on the job, and she was
             the target. Now Bill was the
             greatest assassin of the 20th
             century. In fact the term HITMAN
             was coined for him. And he rarely
             performs actual assassinations
             anymore. However every once in
             awhile - to keep his hand in - he
             does. Only he plays a game. He
             doesn't start big trouble...he lets
             them start it. If they do, they're
             dead. If they don't, not only won't
             he perform, he'll take the hit off
             the market. It's kind of fun
             watching people gamble when they
             don't know they're gambling, isn't
             it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



                       L.F.
             Get my money back. Don't kill him.
             Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



                    BILL
          Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



                    BILL
          Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK FRAME
TITLE CARD:


                        Chapter seven

                     "The lonely grave of
                        Paula Schultz"



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

                           "The city of
                          Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



                    BUDD
          Great day in the morning. Brother
          Bill livin up to his familia
          obligation.



                    BILL
          How ya doin' Budd?



                    BUDD
          Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
          mad rush of wild parties and
          wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



                    BUDD
          Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
          Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



                    BILL
          It's Elle. Want to say hello?



                    BUDD
          Never said "bye," can't seem to
          think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.



                    BUDD
          What'd ya wanna talk about?



                    BILL
          Are you not going to invite me in?



                    BUDD
          No.



                    BILL
          May I ask why not?



                    BUDD
          It stinks in there, that's why. Now
          what's so important it requires a
          reunion?

                                                TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



                    BUDD
          You tryin to tell me she cut her
          way through eighty-eight bodyguards
          'fore she got to O-Ren?



                    BILL
          No. There wasn't really eighty
          eight of them, they just called
          themselves The Crazy 88.



                    BUDD
          Why.



                    BILL

          I dunno, I guess they thought it
          sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
          26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
          attacked. They all fell under her
          Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



                    BUDD
          She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



                    BILL
          She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



                    BUDD
          He made her one? Didn't he swear a
          blood oath never to make another
          sword?



                    BILL
          It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



                    BUDD
          Them Japs know how to carry a
          grudge don't they? Or is it just
          you tend to bring that out in
          people?



                    BILL
              (pause)
          I know this is a ridiculous
          question before I ask, but you by
          any chance haven't kept up with
          your swordplay?



                    BUDD
          Hell, I pawned that years ago.



                    BILL
          You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

                    BUDD
          Yep.

The disrespect is pain.



                    BILL
          It was priceless.



                    BUDD
          Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
          I got me 250 Dollars for it.



                    BILL
          Since it was a gift from me, why
          didn't you offer me the chance to
          buy it back?



                    BUDD
          Because that would've required me
          to acknowledge your existence.
          Drunken bum though I may be, I
          don't need booze that bad. But who
          the hell gives a crap anyway. That
          bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
          points for killin a white trash
          piece of shit like me with a
          samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
          titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
          fight me, all she gotta do is come
          down to the Club, start some shit,
          and we'll be in a a fight.



                    BILL
          -- Budd, you need to listen to me.
          I know we haven't spoken for quite
          some time, and the last time we
          spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
          you need to get over being mad at
          me, and start becoming afraid of
          Bea. Because she is coming, and
          she's coming to kill you. And
          unless you accept my assistance, I
          have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

                       BILL
             Can't we forget the past, and look
             at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



                       BUDD
             And what would that happy side be?



                       BILL
             She's brought "the boys" back
             together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



                       BUDD
             I appreciate the concern on your
             face, but there's a difference
             'tween "the boys", time can't
             erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
             don't Jew outta payin my
             comeuppance. That woman deserves
             her revenge. And we deserve to die.
             But then again, so does she. So I
             guess we'll just see now, won't we.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



                       TED
             You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
             school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



                       STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd.



                    BUDD
          Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



                    STRIPPER
          Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
          it again. There's shitty water all
          over the floor.



                    BUDD
          I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



                       THE BRIDE
          Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



                     BUDD
           Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
           like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



                     BUDD

          You done got a double dose of rock
          salt, right in the ole tit.
          Now not havin tits as fine or as
          big as yours, I can't even imagine
          how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



                    BUDD
          ...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



                    BUDD
          Now I know when it    comes to a rock
          salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
          much like a expert    bout now. But
          truth be told, you    ain't felt all
          rock salt's got to    offer till you
          took a double dose    in your
          backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



                    BUDD
          That gentled ya down, didn't it?
          Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
          two barrels of rock salt dug deep
          in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.



                      ELLE
          Bill?



                    BUDD
          Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.



                      ELLE
          ....Budd?



                      BUDD
          Bingo.



                    ELLE
          And what do I owe this dubious
          pleasure?



                    BUDD
          I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
          never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.



                    ELLE
          Do you mean what I think you mean?



                    BUDD
          If you think I mean I got 'er, you
          thought right.

                    ELLE
          Did you kill her?



                    BUDD
          Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
          it easy enough. She's so gentle
          right now, I could preform her coup
          de grace with a rock.



                    ELLE
          What are you waiting for, run outta
          liquid courage.



                    BUDD
          No. It's just...I ain't killed
          nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
          just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
          Christ, kinda made me a promise I
          wasn't gonna. Be that however it
          is. Back when I did kill people...I
          got paid for it. Just don't seem
          right...turn amateur this time of
          life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.



                    BUDD (O.S.)
          Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
          hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.



                    BUDD
          A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
          sword. And I'm here to tell ya
          Elle, that's what I call sharp.



                      ELLE
          How much?



                    BUDD
          Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
          priceless and all.

          ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.



          BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.



          ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?



          BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.



          ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?



          BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.



          ELLE
What's the terms?



          BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?



          ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One

          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          You kill her tonight.
              (pause)
          And one more thing.



                    BUDD
          You said one condition.



                     ELLE
          It's a caveat to the same
          condition.



                       BUDD
          What?



                    ELLE
          She must suffer to her last breath.



                    BUDD
          That Elle darlin, I can pretty
          damwell guarantee.



                    ELLE
          Then I'll see you in the morning
          millionaire.

                                                 CUT TO:



OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



                    BUDD
          Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          Look at those eyes. This bitch is
          furious. You grab her feet, I'll
          get her head.
              (ENGLISH)
          Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



                    BUDD (SPANISH)
          In America white women call this
          the silent treatment.
              (laughing)
          And we let 'em think, we don't like
          it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



                    BUDD
          Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
          this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



                    BUDD
          Looky here bitch, this is a can of
          mace. Now you're goin underground
          tonight, and that's all there is to
          it. But, when I bury ya, I was
          gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

                       BUDD
          But if    you're gonna act like    a
          horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
          Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
          you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
          alive.    So what's it gonna be
          sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



                    BUDD
          You may be stupid, but at least you
          ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



                        THE BRIDE
             Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.

                     THE BRIDE
          Well, now that you've had a nice,
          good cry, let's figure out how to
          get out of here? You're breathing
          like you just been fuckin. Calm
          down...close your mouth, and start
          breathing short breaths, through
          your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          That's a lot better. But you're
          still too agitated. Can you hear
          your heart? It's like I'm buried
          alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
          that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
          No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
          you can. The darkness will have a
          calming effect. Now turn off that
          fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.



INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.



                    BUDD
              (into phone)
          Yellow?



INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.



                       ELLE
             Didja do it?



                       BUDD
             Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
             speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

                        "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:


                "SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



                       BILL (V.O.)
             Once upon a time in China, some
             believe around the year, one-double
             knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
