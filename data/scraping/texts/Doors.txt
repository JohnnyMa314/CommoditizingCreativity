                                     MORRISON'S VOICE
                         The movie will begin in five moments 
                         The mindless voice announced 
                         All those unseated will await the 
                         next show 
                         We filed slowly, languidly into the 
                         hall 
                         The auditorium was fast and silent 
                         As we seated and were darkened 
                         The voice continued 
                         "The program for this evening is not 
                         new 
                         You've seen this entertainment 
                         Through and through 
                         You've seen your birth, your life 
                         and death 
                         You might recall all the rest 
                         Did you have a good world when you 
                         died? 
                         Enough to base a movie on?"

               FADE IN:

               INT. RECORDING STUDIO (LAST SESSION) - LA DEC 1970 - NIGHT

               A dark silence hovers along the deserted, bunker-like studio. 
               MIKE stands and booms shadow a grand piano...

               The ENGINEER waits in the booth, lit, alert man, bored, 
               fiddling...

                                     ENGINEER
                         Hey Jim, It's your birthday man, 
                         whaddaya say we try this another 
                         night...

               Camera moving tentatively along the shadows, discovering the 
               sidelight on a Navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a chair; 
               moving to a candle's orange flutter on pages written with 
               verse... a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of Irish 
               Bushmill's whiskey.

                                     VOICE
                              (off)
                         Kill the lights a little more, will 
                         ya John?

               They might drop a bit more... Camera crawling past the FINGERS 
               weaving a new cigarette out of the Marlboro pack. An ashtray 
               full of butts... and an asthmatic horrid cough, filled with 
               phlegm... crawling up the slight paunch in the bright jersey 
               with #66 on it... stitched on the sleeve is the team mascot -- 
               an American Indian in full headdress.

                                     ENGINEER
                              (off)
                         Hey man, how come the Doors aren't 
                         in on this?

               Camera revealing JAMES DOUGLAS MORRISON, -- 27, poet, buried 
               in the shadows, curls of cigarette smoke about his haunted 
               sensuous eyes, meditative lips scragged with beard and long 
               greasy hair, not a pretty sight, yet a man full and bold and 
               struggling for survival through his words... beneath the 
               Bushmill moon, he takes the tambourine and shakes it violently 
               in our face

                                     JIM
                         No music, No Doors. Let's roll... Is 
                         everybody in?... Is Everybody in?... 
                         Is everybody in? The ceremony is 
                         about to begin...

               He shakes a TAMBOURINE at the mike and one of his sudden 
               giant Indian YELLS rock through the studio.

                                     JIM
                         WAKE UP!!!! HAS THIS DREAM STOPPED!!!!

               Music riffs from "American Prayer". AUDIENCE SOUNDS ghostly 
               on the track. The ENGINEER reeling backwards from the sudden 
               shift in sound, cursing silent.

                                     JIM VOICE
                         Let me tell you about the heartache 
                         and the loss of God Wandering 
                         wandering in hopeless night Indian's 
                         scattered on dawn's highway bleeding 
                         ghosts crowd the young childs fragile 
                         eggshell mind...
                              (wind sounds)

               The GRIN on Jim's face magnesium flares out to:

               EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1940'S)

               The blinding YELLOWNESS of the desert, so barren, so hot it 
               stings to look at. An OLD CHEVROLET winds through the yellow-
               orange landscape beneath a brooding blue SKY crackling with 
               ELECTRICITY -- the storm coming in in the distance as the 
               MUSIC writhes out at us like a reptile from under a rock -- 
               the beat of RIDERS ON THE STORM.

               DOORS SONG 
               Riders on the storm (2) 
               Into this house we're born 
               Into this world we're thrown 
               Like a dog without a bone 
               An actor out on loan 
               Riders on the storm

               CREDITS ROLL, OVER THIS DREAMSCAPE

                              (continues over imagery)
                         ...me and my mother and father and 
                         grandmother and grandfather were 
                         driving through the desert at dawn 
                         and a truckload of Indian workers 
                         had either hit another car or just -- 
                         I don't know what happened... Indians 
                         were scattered all over the highway 
                         bleeding to death.

               INT. CAR - DAY

               MOM, DAD, the youngest BABY in the front seat -- pointing at 
               the storm.

               GRANDMA & GRANDAD in the back with JIM, about 4 and his 
               SISTER, 3 asleep.

               Mom's a beauty and Dad's an austere handsome military man in 
               civilian clothes, mouthing words -- look, wake them up, a 
               desert storm... but we barely hear

               A LIGHTNING BOLT shreds the blue sky with a thunderous sound, 
               frightening dawn of creation...

               Grandma nudging Jim awake. His eyes open --

               Just as the car turns the bend -- revealing

               An overturned TRUCK lying in the road -- dead and wounded 
               INDIANS everywhere... A cop car, ambulance. A terrible 
               accident...

               The first thing Jim sees...

               An old INDIAN FACE staring at him...

               The car pulling alongside, Dad rolling his window down... 
               asking if he can help (SOUNDLESS) A line of wailing INDIAN 
               WOMEN, CHILDREN

               Mom's scared face...

                                     JIM VOICE
                         ...but it was the first time I tasted 
                         fear. I musta been about four, like 
                         a child is just like a flower, his 
                         head is floating in the breeze.

               Grandma trying to hide Jim's face but he looks back...

               THE COP WAVING THEM THROUGH

               The kid looking back through the rear window, terrified -- 
               his first view of death. The bodies, the sense of doom 
               overlaying the land -- a child's worst nightmare.

                                     MOM
                         It's just a dream, Jimmy, just a 
                         dream

               SONG 
               (continues) 
               There's a killer on the road 
               His brain is squirming like a toad 
               Take a long holiday 
               Let your children play 
               If you give this man a ride 
               Sweet family will die 
               There's a killer on the road

               The boy's eyes going back to the Indian MAN looking at him... 
               then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the 
               asphalt... the dying man's face, twisted, moaning, amazing 
               eyes at the point of death -- they settle on Jim

                                     MOM
                         It's just a dream Jimmy, just a dream

               A strange SOUND occurs -- the rattle of an ancient gourd, 
               "shi-chi-chi, shi-chi-chi". Something flying through the 
               air. A bull-roarer, a whirling leather thong, announcing the 
               appearance of a shaman.

               INTO JIM -- his eyes staring out the back His receding point 
               of view -- the Indians, the overturned truck...

                                     JIM VOICE
                         ...The reaction I get now looking 
                         back is the soul of the ghosts of 
                         those dead Indians -- maybe one or 
                         two of them were just running around 
                         freaking out and just leaped into my 
                         soul -- and they're still there.
                              (wind, music)

               SONG 
               Girl you gotta love your man (2) 
               Take him by the hand 
               Make him understand

               The car pulling away across the giant 1940's landscape

               Panning up the black chino pants to JIM MORRISON, now 20, 
               steel seaman's suitcase in hand, thumbing a ride, the road 
               sign behind him saying "Los angeles 370 miles"

               SONG 
               The world on you depends 
               Our life will never end 
               Girl you gotta love your man

               A LARGE LIZARD in the dust cocks its head, blinks, as the 
               boots walk by to the car pulling over.

               INT. CAR

               JIM in the backseat packed with HUSBAND, WIFE, CHILDREN, 
               DOG, MOTHER-IN-LAW. Between boy and man, eyes ancient and 
               new. He wears his favorite color: black -- torn black chinos, 
               paint-spotted black t-shirt, a slouch his favorite pose but 
               the eyes and smile can be warm and shy like a little boy, 
               gentle surface, storm in the brain.

               The HUSBAND, now looking at Jim a little nervously, pushes 
               up the Perry Como on the radio... as it cuts to a sudden 
               news flash:

                                     RADIO
                         ...from the Texas School Book 
                         Depository. We repeat. President 
                         John F. Kennedy was shot a few minutes 
                         ago in Dallas!

               SLOW MOTION: The Husband's face distorting, saying something 
               on the track like: "What! God NO!" but it's subdued, low. 
               Trying other stations.

               Jim turns to look out his window, as if he already knew.

                                     RADIO
                              (2nd VOICE)
                         ...taken to Parkland Memorial 
                         Hospital. There's no word on the 
                         President's condition. Mrs. Kennedy 
                         is...

               The WIFE'S and HUSBAND'S VOICES seem lost in the background.

                                     WIFE & HUSBAND
                         Oh God, Oh God. Not the President 
                         for Christ's sake. Oh God -- WHO'S 
                         NEXT?

               On Jim -- staring out the window. "Who's next!"

               EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - LOS ANGELES - DAY (1965)

               SUBTITLE READS: VENICE, CALIFORNIA 1965

               CREDITS continue to their conclusion as we segue into the 
               BLUENESS of VENICE, CALIFORNIA, 1965 -- the dawn of a new 
               age. All was possible.

               Individual SHOTS of the BOARDWALK throbbing with a feast of 
               HIPPIES, head shops, ARTISTS drawing psychedelic murals, POT 
               SMOKERS, MUSCLE BUILDERS, tambourines accompanying the 
               transister radios on the Beach Boys and "I Got You Babe", 
               dogs chasing frisbees, BIKINI BODIES on the beach, LSD sold 
               over the counter... set to the upbeat chords of HELLO I LOVE 
               YOU

               DOORS SONG 
               Hello I love you 
               Won't you tell me your name? 
               Hello I love you 
               Let me jump in your game 
               She's walking down the street 
               Blind to every eye she meets 
               Do you think you'll be the guy 
               To make the queen of the angels sigh?

               JIM, in torn black chinos, no shirt, walking real slow past 
               it all, carrying a notebook of his own and a paperback of 
               Baudelaire, his eyes settling on...

               A YOUNG BEAUTY and her yellow labrador -- a fashionable thin, 
               long, red-haired "20th century fox" in jeans moving through 
               the crowd...

               He thinks about it -- a fraction of eternity -- and he's 
               off... after her.

               EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

               She moves along its banks, as if the universe moved to her 
               rhythm, turning once to look back. Jim caught in her eyes. 
               They're alone. Now he's the one seized by doubt. He slows, 
               pretends to take another interest.

               DOORS SONG 
               She holds her head so high 
               Like a statue in the sky 
               Her arms are wicked 
               And her legs are long 
               When she moves 
               My brain screams out this song

               EXT. VENICE CANAL - ANOTHER CANAL - DAY

               As she turns into another street, he resumes following her. 
               She gets to a house, goes in. There's a group of people 
               partying. He stops, watches.

               DOORS SONG 
               Sidewalk crouches at her feet 
               Like a dog that begs for something sweet 
               Do you hope to make her see you, fool? 
               Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

               The two story house has a quaint run-down charm. Friends 
               have dropped by, people smoking joints, beers.

               She's on the upstairs balcony -- talking with a YOUNG MAN 
               (professor type) in his 30's, who passes her a joint.

               JIM lurks in the shadows of the trees; he's been standing 
               outside watching... The MUSIC shifts to the quieter LOVE 
               STREET.

               DOORS SONG 
               She lives on Love Street 
               Lingers long on Love Street 
               She has a house and garden 
               I would like to see what happens

               The YOUNG MAN gestures, and goes back inside the house. She's 
               alone now on the balcony, sitting on a kitchen table...

               It's now or never. Jim scales the tree alongside the house 
               with the agility of a gymnast.

               DOORS SONG 
               She has robes and she has monkeys 
               Lazy diamond studded flunkies 
               She has wisdom and knows what to do 
               She has me and she has you

               The girl's grinding up pot in an old shoebox with a spoon 
               and kitchen strainer. She looks up and sees his crotch three 
               feet from her face, balanced there effortlessly on the railing 
               like a highwire act, opens her mouth in surprise.

               Jim drops softly to the balcony, a smile of disarming 
               gentleness.

                                     JIM
                         Hi...

                                     GIRL
                         Wow! Hi...
                              (looking at the tree)
                         You have a problem with doors?

                                     JIM
                         Waste of time...

               His head cocked slightly onto his left shoulder, he drawls, 
               southern gentleman, polite, slow, thoughtful as if he had 
               all the time in the world, as if the guy would never come 
               back.

                                     JIM
                         I followed you... from the beach...

                                     GIRL
                              (impressed)
                         Wow! You followed me? Why?

                                     JIM
                         ...cause... you're the one...

               He moves. Kisses her swiftly, softly, right on the lips.

                                     GIRL
                              (mesmerized, awkward)
                         Wow... neat...
                              (looks back)
                         ...maybe you should meet my old man?

                                     JIM
                         Later. You got a name?

               He looks into her face. Classic American face, freckles, big 
               round eyes soft as rain, long sunset red hair. She feels his 
               intense, starving eyes. He kisses her a second time.

               The YOUNG MAN coming back with the rolling paper -- sees 
               him.

               As he hops back on the railing -- swings out into the tree -- 
               looks back once.

                                     JIM
                         Mine's Jim.

               A moment. She must decide. The YOUNG MAN within earshot.

                                     GIRL
                         Pam...

               The ice broken in that instant. Jim smiles.

                                     JIM
                         Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim...

               He vanishes. The Man abreast of Pamela, as if he's seen a 
               vision.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Who the hell was that?

                                     PAMELA
                              (everything's cool)
                         That's Jim. My new friend.

               INT. UCLA SCREENING ROOM - DAY (1965)

               On the screen a 16mm black and white student film of a 
               stunning BLOND in black bra, panties, garters dancing in 
               black heels on top of a TV set. panning down to images of 
               goose-stepping Nazis and a Nuremberg rally on the set. Sounds 
               of lovemaking and an Indian peyote ceremony from the track, 
               an Indian holy man incanting... Jim's VOICE comes on the 
               track as well.

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         Nietzche said "all great things must 
                         first wear monstrous and terrifying 
                         masks in order to inscribe themselves 
                         on the hearts of humanity". Listen 
                         children -- to the sound of the 
                         Nuremberg night.

               STUDENTS in the audience groan at the pretention of it. Moving 
               to JIM's eyes hidden in his parka hood, peeking through at 
               the screen.

               A CLOSEUP now of JIM on screen looking straight into the 
               lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe, and winks.

                                     JIM VOICE
                              (on screen)
                         Have you ever seen God? -- a mandala. 
                         A symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes. 
                         Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music. 
                         Voices. Touched? An animal. Your 
                         hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water 
                         and wine

                                     STUDENTS
                              (ad lib)
                         SSSSssss... ego trip man, c'mon!

               RAY MANZAREK, a tall student with powerful voice and manner, 
               thick glasses, long hair sweeping down over his eyes, leans 
               over to Jim.

                                     RAY
                         Hey man it's great, don't listen to 
                         em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry 
                         man, everything Godard stands for.

               The lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker 
               off. Hissing and a big Bronx cheer summarize the feelings of 
               the 100 odd STUDENTS crammed into a bunker-like theater.

               A youngish INSTRUCTOR stirs to the front row from a row of 
               upset FACULTY. Hands shooting up to criticize.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         This is pretty shocking stuff Mr. 
                         Morrison. And I might say indulgent. 
                         Naziism and masturbation, when used 
                         for shock value, are not art. But to 
                         be constructive, let's start with 
                         your intention. What was it?

                                     STUDENT 1
                         It was a bore!! That's what!
                              (laughter)

               TRICK, BONES and JACK, three friends sitting next to Jim, 
               shoot their hands up.

                                     TRICK

                         No it wasn't. It was worse!

                                     TRICK
                         A guy sleeping for seven hours...

                         ...is less pretentious! There was no 
                         political consciousness. Naziism 
                         is...

                                     JACK
                         Hey hold on man! You guys are the 
                         facists!

                                     BONES
                         It takes genitalism to absurdity 
                         man, just cause the squares here 
                         can't dig it cause the film school's 
                         still so square...

                                     VOICES
                         Oh c'mon man, give it a break. Boo! 
                         Beatniks go home! Take another 
                         mushroom...

               A cacophony of voices, critics, emotions blend out over Jim's 
               quiet eyes.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         HOLD IT DOWN!!... Mr. Morrison -- 
                         what are your feelings?

                                     JIM
                         I quit.
                              (walks out)

               EXT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT

               JIM, BONES, TRICK, JACK approaching the bar. MUSIC of "GLORIA" 
               blasting from the door, CHICKS popping in and out, definitely 
               college crowd circa '65.

                                     TRICK
                              (to Jim)

                                     BONES
                         You can't quit, you gotta voice. 
                         People can't dig cause they don't 
                         understand yet.

                                     JACK
                         If you're an individual, if you're 
                         too good, they wanna cut your dick 
                         off. Look what happened to Orson 
                         Wells.

                         You quit now, they'll yank your 
                         deferment in no time and they'll get 
                         you for Vietnam man. Three more months 
                         you graduate.

                                     BONES
                         Be cool, you never learned fuckin 
                         patience Morrison, you want everything 
                         at once.

                         films and fuck what they think.

                                     JIM
                         You know what I think?

               He slows, a dramatic young lion pose, surveying the girls.

                                     BONES
                         Yeah whadday you think?

                                     JIM
                         You really want to know what I think?

               The cronies wait, anticipating something inescapably evil to 
               escape his lips.

                                     BONES
                         Yeah yeah, whatddaya think?

                         I think we gotta get really ripped!

               INT. TURKEY JOINT WEST - NIGHT

               Tall bespectacled RAY MANZAREK is banging out GLORIA on the 
               piano in bad Jerry Lee Lewis style.

                                     RAY
                         I tell you bout my baby 'bout five 
                         foot four from head to toe She came 
                         to my room Just 'bout midnight She 
                         makes me feel so good She makes me 
                         feel alright

               Camera moving to reveal JOHN DENSMORE wiry, solid on the 
               drums... moving on to ROBBIE KRIEGER, wispy, ethereal looking, 
               the youngest, flamenco-type moves on his early electric 
               guitar. Also a HARMONICA PLAYER and a BASE. They all seem 
               slightly embarrassed by either the cheap sound system feedback 
               or Ray's warbling, but the crowd couldn't care less -- a 
               German beerhall, they want noise and sex.

               JIM and his GANG, beers in hand, mouth back the words, beers 
               everywhere shoved to the smokey ceiling, everyone on their 
               feet, nuts with spring fever. Jim eyeing the GIRL next to 
               him.

                                     JIM
                         You know what I'd like to do to you?

                                     GIRL
                              (waiting, intrigued)
                         No what?

                                     JIM
                         You really want to know what I'd 
                         like to do to you?

                                     GIRL
                         What!

               The FOOTBALL TEAM TYPES edge over nearby, one of them picking 
               out Jim with a glare.

                                     JIM
                              (whispering)
                         Wanna hear the scream of the 
                         butterfly...

               She looks puzzled by the suggestion.

                                     FOOTBALL PLAYER
                         Hey Morrison!

                                     JIM
                              (eluding the man)
                         Can we have a couple of beers. You're 
                         not even an asshole man -- you're a 
                         semihole.

               He evades the football man's grasp, elusive physicality. He 
               hops over tables, heading for the stage. Other KIDS are up 
               on the stage dancing, but Jim goes right up alongside RAY, 
               shaking his hips like Elvis. Ray giving him the mike. Improv 
               time.

                              (singing)
                         She came to my room 
                         She came on my floor 
                         She came on my bed 
                         She came on my face 
                         Ooooooh I want to wrap your legs 
                         around my head baby baby and her 
                         name was Gloria

               They love it. The place going wild. The girl with the football 
               player wanting him.

               INT. RAY'S CAR - FREEWAY - NIGHT

               JIM is insane on beers in the back seat, reaching over the 
               wheel to try to drive the car for RAY who is flailing at 
               him. Jim pulling Ray's hair...

                                     JIM
                              (barely comprehensible)
                         HA HA HA HA HA! COME ON, LET'S DRIVE 
                         TO MEXICO MAN. TIJUANA. LET'S GET 
                         LOST!

               Jammed into the sedan are TRICK, BONES, ROBBIE, JOHN...

                                     RAY & ALL
                         COOL IT JIM, COME ON COOL IT.

                                     JIM
                         FREEDOM!!! DON'T YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALL 
                         SLAVES!

               As he winds down the window and starts crawling out of the 
               car. Heavy traffic. Ray weaving to avoid another vehicle. 
               Honking horn.

                                     JOHN
                         HE'S GOING OUT! HE'S GOING OUT!

                                     TRICK
                         HE'S GONNA JUMP!

                                     RAY
                         GET HIM BACK IN!

               His waist is out the window, John and all grabbing for his 
               heels.

               EXT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT

               SPECIAL EFFECT: JIM's head six inches from pavement moving 
               at 60 mph through heavy traffic. Screaming, laughing like a 
               maniac. Beeping horns all over the place.

                                     JIM
                         DEATH OLD FRIEND!!

               In the car, madness, raging chaos, the four boys pulling him 
               in.

               EXT./INT. PAMELA'S HOUSE - VENICE CANAL - THAT NIGHT

               Night. Shadows. A tree. A figure moving.

               Awake! 
               Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child my sweet one 
               Choose the day and choose the sign of your day 
               The day's divinity the first thing you see

               Jim slides her upstairs' door open, crawls in next to her 
               bed. She's asleep with her boyfriend. He touches her toe. 
               She awakes, startled.

                                     JIM
                         Come on, come out for a walk, it's a 
                         pretty night.

               EXT. VENICE CANALS - NIGHT

               JIM and PAMELA moving along the byways. A clear starry 
               California night.

               JIM 
               (SONG) 
               A vast radiant beach 
               And a cool jewelled moon 
               Couples naked, race down by its quiet side 
               And we laugh like soft mad children

               There's a crash. They turn bristling.

               A COYOTE lurks under the sickly light of a streetlamp, pulling 
               its head from an overstuffed garbage can, looking back at 
               them.

               EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - NIGHT

               Fires on the boardwalk. Hippies, Bums, Older People. JIM and 
               PAM move through talking, skipping, touching like children.

                         Can I stay with you tonight? We could 
                         talk 'till dawn. I just don't want 
                         to be alone.

                         I've been real upset. I lost my car 
                         on the freeway yesterday. I left it 
                         somewhere and I can't remember where 
                         and when I went back it was gone. My 
                         sister...

                                     JIM
                         I bet you never expected life could 
                         be this hard.

                         And you're still so young.

               She breaks into sobs, seeking his arms. He hugs her.

               structure overlooking the boardwalk.

               PAM glancing through Jim's notebooks as they sit on his 
               sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner, overlooking 
               moon, ocean, scudding clouds and a vast forest of television 
               antennas. Fires burn from the beach.

               In the notebooks, at intervals during the conversation, we 
               see powerful sketches colored in visionary hallucinogenic 
               William Blake mode with writing between. Books are everywhere -- 
               panning Kerouac, Ginsberg, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Mailer, Artaud, 
               mythological works, shamanistic books, a library of stolen 
               ideas.

                         read much poetry in school. I hated 
                         it. What's a "shaman"?

                         a peyote trance. And he gets everyone 
                         in the tribe going and they share in 
                         his vision and it heals them. It's 
                         the same in all cultures -- Greeks, 
                         Jesus. Some Indians say the first 
                         shaman invented sex. He's the one 
                         who makes you crazy.

                         Love... Now. Peyote's like love. 
                         When it's given it's blessed. When 
                         it's sold it's damned. I like peyote. 
                         I like acid, it's easier to get. I 
                         like the spiritual voyage. The first 
                         time I did acid I saw God. I did. I 
                         had a friend who was Christ. And he 
                         was Judas too. I suddenly knew the 
                         secret of everything -- that we're 
                         all one, the universe is one. And 
                         that everything is beautiful.

                         alive by confronting death -- by 
                         experiencing pain.

                         you discover truth you discover what 
                         love is... we're all saying the same 
                         thing. It's "love me and I'll love 
                         you."

                         It's only thru death that you know 
                         life. Jesus, medicine men heal people 
                         by sacrificing their own life.

               Jim has approached closer, amused, looking down.

                                     JIM
                         Hey Ray, try acid man, it's 
                         guaranteed.

               Ray opening his eyes -- his POV -- Jim, slouched, jacket 
               over his shoulder, sun behind him.

                                     RAY
                              (surprised)
                         Morrison... Aw shit. Last trip I 
                         thought I was going through hell's 
                         digestive system. Something painted 
                         by Hieronymus Bosch.

                                     JIM
                         I never had a bummer on acid.

                                     RAY
                         I like naturally high man.

                                     JIM
                         Whatever works. Making movies at MGM 
                         yet?

                                     RAY
                         Well I saw the head of production 
                         and I said Godard doesn't use scripts, 
                         he improvises with his camera and he 
                         said, "great who's Godard?"

                                     JIM
                              (laughs)
                         We gotta take the planet back, 
                         reinvent the Gods, make new myths.

                                     RAY
                         Right on. I thought you went to New 
                         York?

                                     JIM
                         Never got there. Went out to the 
                         desert and uh... got lost y'know. 
                         Days. I been living on Trick's 
                         rooftop. Got stuck on this chick...

                                     RAY
                         Whatcha been doing?

                                     JIM
                         Writing. Poems. Songs.

                                     RAY
                         Songs? Lemme hear one.

                                     JIM
                         I can't sing.

                                     RAY
                         So neither can Dylan. "Johnny's in 
                         the basement mixing up the medicine, 
                         I'm on the pavement thinking about 
                         the government". But he's got the 
                         words man. That's what they want.

                                     JIM
                              (suddenly sings)
                         Let's swim to the moon un hunh 
                         Let's climb thru the tide 
                         Penetrate the evening 
                         That the city sleeps to hide

               Jim has crouched, digging his hand in the sand. As the grains 
               spill out of his fist he has his eyes closed.

               Ray pantomimes chords in the keyboard sand. All of a sudden 
               we're in RAY'S POV -- a mystical moment. Jim singing, no 
               sound, then pure song, unadulterated by atmosphere.

                                     JIM
                         Let's swim out tonight love 
                         It's our turn to try 
                         Parked beside the ocean 
                         On our moonlight drive

               Jim stops, shrugs. Ray looks at him a long beat. Intense 
               eyes, the manner of a man who knows what he wants and cannot 
               be stopped.

                                     RAY
                         Wow!... Y'know man those are hot 
                         lyrics -- really hot!

                                     JIM
                              (pleased)
                         ...could you write the music for 
                         that down, if we went over to your 
                         place, could you write that on your 
                         organ?

                                     RAY
                         Are you kidding! I could fly. You 
                         wrote that? You got others?

                                     JIM
                         A bunch. It's like I'm taking notes 
                         at a rock concert going on inside my 
                         head. I actually hear the music -- 
                         the spirit of the wine y'know, 
                         intoxication.

                                     RAY
                              (slaps him on the 
                              knee)
                         Man. You got a voice like Chet Baker -- 
                         haunted! What the hell happened to 
                         you in the desert? Let's get a rock 
                         and roll band together man and make 
                         a million bucks.

                                     JIM
                         ...be great wouldn't it?

                                     RAY
                              (walking JIM)
                         It's the perfect time man! Two of 
                         the guys outta my band are really 
                         into this. I meditate with them. You 
                         know them... Robbie and John. We 
                         could have it in the can in three 
                         weeks.

                                     JIM
                         Hey why not, I could write the songs 
                         with you guys.

                                     RAY
                         The Stones did it outta the London 
                         School of Economics for Chrissake. 
                         Things are about to explode man. You 
                         can feel it in the air.
                              (points out over the 
                              ocean)
                         Vietnam's right out there. Sides are 
                         being chosen. People wanna fight or 
                         fuck, love or kill, everything's 
                         gonna flame. The planet's screaming 
                         for change, Morrison. Make the myths 
                         man!!

               Jim laughs, loves Ray's ardor as they move along the ocean 
               side.

                                     JIM
                         There oughta be great orgies man. 
                         Like when Dionysus arrived in Greece, 
                         he made all the women mad, leaving 
                         their homes and dancing off in the 
                         mountains. Great golden copulations 
                         in the streets of LA.
                              (looks at a passing 
                              girl)
                         Hey, do you know her?

                                     RAY
                         What do we call ourselves. "Dionysus"?

                                     JIM
                         I got a name.

                                     RAY
                         What?

                                     JIM
                         The Doors.

                                     RAY
                         The Doors?
                              (facial distaste)
                         That's the most ridiculous...
                              (then)
                         ...you mean the doors in your mind? 
                         Like the Huxley book.

                                     JIM
                         "The Doors of Perception"? Acid...

                                     RAY
                         Yeah sure mescaline experiments -- 
                         reducing the sugar flow to the brain. 
                         Great book.

                                     JIM
                         It's from William Blake actually, 
                         the line -- "when the doors of 
                         perception are cleansed -- things 
                         will appear as they truly are..."

                                     RAY
                              (finishes)
                         -- infinite". It's great, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         So where do we start? How do we start? 
                         Where are the girls?

                                     RAY
                         Rehearsing. You're moving off the 
                         rooftop and in with me and Dorothy.

               As they walk off, the two of them along the edge of the 
               Pacific. A dog jumping for a frisbee. The music of MOONLIGHT 
               DRIVE now riffs over the real song now.

               DOORS SONG 
               Let's swim to the moon 
               Let's climb thru the tide 
               Penetrate the evening 
               That the city sleeps to hide...

                                                             DISSOLVING TO:

               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - VENICE BEACH - DAY

               The first heavy strains of BREAK ON THROUGH driving over the 
               DISSOLVE. It sounds bad technically, but it's hot. Random 
               raw screams and shouting. PAM is crosslegged on the floor, 
               clapping to the music, number one fan.

                                     JIM & DOORS
                              (live)
                         The day destroys the night 
                         Night divides the day 
                         Tried to run 
                         Tried to hide 
                         Break on thru to the other side

               JIM straining to make it work, jumping around violent, still 
               not in control. Yet searching. JOHN cutting out.

                                     JOHN
                         That's really square. Let's hip it 
                         up. Jump on your cues.

                                     RAY
                         Tighten it up. Stay with the beat 
                         Jim. You're dragging.

                                     JIM
                         Let's try it again, come on. I'm 
                         just getting into it.

                                     PAM
                              (on floor)
                         I think it's hot!!

                                     ROBBIE
                              (strumming)
                         I still think the lyrics are weird 
                         man.

                                     JOHN
                              (frustrated)
                         I still think it sounds like the 
                         bottom of a fishbowl man.

                                     JIM
                              (to Robbie, aggravated)
                         Then you write one man! We need more 
                         songs anyway. We all gotta go back 
                         and write.

               They're drained, tired, in a large rehersal/living room 30 
               feet high, fronted by large glass windows looking out at the 
               beach at Marina. The room is filled with golden, gorgeous 
               setting sunlight.

               PAMELA goes to the kitchen with DOROTHY, Ray's Japanese 
               fiancee.

                                     ROBBIE
                         I been working on something goes 
                         like this... A minor.
                              (chords his guitar)
                         "You know that it would be untrue 
                         You know that I would be a liar 
                         If I was to say to you 
                         Girl, we couldn't get much higher" 
                         F sharp... chorus 
                         "Come on baby, light my fire 
                         Try to set the night on fire..."

               Robbie's voice is tinny but something immediate's in the 
               air, all the radar out.

                                     RAY
                         Okay man there's some good changes 
                         in there.

                                     JIM
                         Got any more lyrics?

                                     ROBBIE
                              (gives Jim a page of 
                              lyrics)
                         Some. I call it "Light My Fire". I 
                         figger if I'm gonna compete with 
                         your stuff it's gotta be about earth, 
                         fire or snakes.

                                     JIM
                         Don't underestimate Death.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds 
                         man, we're not folk rock man. How 
                         'bout trying it with a Latin beat.

                                     ROBBIE
                         I thought we could do the usual verse 
                         chorus verse chorus and

                                     JOHN
                         We don't need a bridge.

                                     ROBBIE
                         Yeah, we could maybe improvise a 
                         couple piano and guitar solos over 
                         it
                              (kicks in second verse)
                         "The time to hesitate is through"
                              (doesn't have the 
                              second line)
                         Du du duh dud dada . . .

                                     JIM
                              (spontaneous)
                         "No time to wallow in the mire 
                         Try now we can only lose 
                         And our love become a funeral pyre 
                         Come on baby light my fire"

               John drumming it, different, more Latin.

                                     JIM
                         Pretty good! Pretty neat!!

                                     RAY
                              (to John)
                         Nice groove, John. Chaka chaka chaka, 
                         then bula burump bula
                              (to Robbie)
                         ...you're right, it could take a 
                         coupla long solos, that's wild man, 
                         like Butterfield did on "East-West" -- 
                         really hip.

                                     ROBBIE
                         Y'ever heard Coltrane's "Favorite 
                         Things"?

                                     JOHN
                              (hitting the drums)
                         Yeah -- maybe stretch it out and put 
                         it in 4/4 on bass, 3/4 on guitar and 
                         snare.

                                     RAY
                              (clicking, excited)
                         Why not! A minor to B minor. Jazz! 
                         That then is jazz! But it needs a 
                         hook. Something. Give me some space. 
                         I need some space. Leave the room 
                         guys. Come on! Go!

               The three excluded Doors head out to the beach like obedient 
               schoolboys while Ray fools with his organ.

               EXT. VENICE BEACH - DAY

               As they go out, JIM hugging ROBBIE's head to his shoulder as 
               they feel the excitement of a new song.

                                     JOHN
                              (irritated at Ray)
                         Guy's obnoxious, man always bossin' 
                         people around! I thought we were 
                         equals!

                                     JIM
                         Aren't we?
                              (to Robbie)
                         That was great Robbie. Whaddaya 
                         thinking about when you play?

                                     ROBBIE
                         Don't know. Mostly the fish in my 
                         fish tank.

                                     JIM
                              (laughs)
                         Hey whadya say we take some of that 
                         Tijuana acid and see what kinda 
                         trouble we can get into tonight?

                                     ROBBIE
                         The chicks always go for you man. I 
                         get the dogs.

                                     JIM
                         Then we'll start a religion or plan 
                         a murder or go to Tijuana.

                                     JOHN
                         Whatsamatter with you man, what about 
                         Pam, you got the morals of a coyote.

                                     JIM
                         Why you wanna sleep with her John, 
                         just to bug me?

                                     JOHN
                         Hell NO!

                                     JIM
                         ...means "hell yes". She likes you 
                         man, she really does and y'all should. 
                         What's a rock and roll band for man, 
                         if you can't party all night and do 
                         bad things?

                                     RAY
                              (yelling from the 
                              house)
                         I GOT IT I GOT IT... GET IN HERE. 
                         HURRY.

                                     JOHN
                         Sieg Heil!

               As they head back.

               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - DAY

               TIGHT on RAY like a schoolmaster cueing them.

                                     RAY
                         Okay here it is. Bach and Rock. Count 
                         it off John

                                     JOHN
                              (clicking)
                         1... 2... 1 - 2 - 3
                              (crack)

               It goes. The famous organ intro to LIGHT MY FIRE blends over 
               the room like magic, carrying JIM, ROBBIE, JOHN, DOROTHY, 
               PAMELA along over:

               EXT. SUNSET STRIP (TRAVELLING) - NIGHT (1966)

               A row of NIGHTCLUBS glisten off the hoods of passing traffic. 
               Marquees announce: THE BYRDS, RED ROOSTER, LOVE, THE HERD, 
               TURTLES, CAPTAIN BEEFHEART. The CLUBS are PANDORA'S BOX, THE 
               TRIP, CIRO'S, BIDO LITO'S, GAZZARRI'S, THE EXPERIENCE... . 
               Headlights and neon intercut with:

               DOCUMENTARY TYPE SHOTS of TEENAGERS, HIPPIES, LONGHAIRS, 
               running summer rampant, banging tambourines. COPS busting 
               kids against cars on the street as PARENTS go by rolling up 
               their windows. The action was on the street. LIGHT MY FIRE 
               carries over the montage.

               DOORS SONG 
               You know that it would be untrue etc.

                                     JIM VOICE
                              (last session)
                         The music was new black polished 
                         chrome and came over the summer like 
                         liquid night.

               EXT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

               "THE DOORS -- BAND FROM VENICE" on the marquee... moving 
               down to a motley crew of TEENAGE GIRLS, underage, trying to 
               get past the BOUNCER. The sounds of BREAK ON THROUGH carry 
               past when the doors open and close admitting a SAILOR.

                                     GIRL GROUPIE
                              (approaching, to 2nd 
                              girl)
                         Is that horny motherfucker in the 
                         black pants here tonight?

                                     BOUNCER
                         IDs! IDs! Can't get in without an 
                         I.D..

                                     GIRL 2
                         Oh please. I forgot my I.D.. I'm on 
                         the list.

                                     BOUNCER
                         I forgot my list.

               INT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

               BREAK ON THROUGH blasting out at us from a sleazehole -- 
               half full -- BIKERS, SAILORS, HOOKERS, a baseball game on 
               the TV. A dance floor the size of a bed, the DOORS on a tiny 
               platform above the bar, London newspapers on the wall.

                                     JIM & DOORS
                              (live)
                         We chased our pleasures here 
                         Dug our treasures there 
                         Can you still recall the time we 
                         cried 
                         BREAK on through to the other side 
                         (3)

               Some groupies have formed a small fan club at the base of 
               the stage, muscling past PAM, but most people ignore them, 
               drinking, arguing, dancing to their own fuckbeats. Possibly 
               this has something to do with the fact that JIM sings with 
               his back to all of them.

               JOHN looking over furious at RAY who mutters under the music.

                                     RAY
                         Turn around Jim! Come on let 'em in.

                                     JIM
                         I found an island in your arms 
                         A country in your eyes 
                         Arms that chained us, eyes that lied
                              (CHORUS)

               Jim jumps around violently to the front, getting the attention 
               of all. Rubbing his leather pants against the mike stand, 
               leaning against it, not yet comfortable with the extrovert 
               side of himself, eyes closed, but starting to enjoy it. He 
               sings to Pam.

               INT. BACKSTAGE - THE FOG - THAT NIGHT

               JERRY, the ex-vice cop manager who runs the joint, can't 
               understand the appeal, talking to JIM and ROBBIE who are 
               packing and hauling their equipment out. DOROTHY is there.

                                     PAM
                              (innocently)
                         So Jerry... do we get paid for this?

                                     JERRY
                              (ignoring her)
                         What shit, "day destroys the night", 
                         "crawl back in your brain", "go 
                         insane". What do people wanna pay 
                         money to hear that shit.

                                     JIM
                              (explains it, gentle)
                         The greater the suffering, the more 
                         terrible the events, the greater the 
                         pleasure Jerry. They want it, it's 
                         catharsis. Like the ancient Greeks.

                                     JERRY
                              (amused)
                         We're in Los Angeles punk, how would 
                         you know, they like your pants, 
                         they're not listenin' to you, what 
                         the hell they see in you I...

                                     JIM
                              (laughs)
                         But they understand Jerry. All our 
                         real desires are unconscious and 
                         unseen. . .

                                     JERRY
                              (scratching his head)
                         ...you're the weirdest fuckin' guy I 
                         ever...

                                     JIM
                         You love us?

                                     JERRY
                         I love ya. You got two more shows to 
                         do.

               Camera gliding across the small crowded smokey room to RAY 
               and JOHN in conversation with a slick Beverly Hills MANAGER 
               type.

                                     MANAGER
                         ...I got some real tight record 
                         company connections, just leave it 
                         to me man, I'll take you guys all 
                         the fuckin' way, you blew my mind 
                         out there.

                                     RAY
                         Yeah right, but what about the music?

                                     MANAGER
                         Hey the music? I love it man, that's 
                         why we're talking right? Some of 
                         it's a little on the dark side though. 
                         Ya know ya oughta get some tunes 
                         like Herman's Hermits stuff -- "Mrs. 
                         Brown you got a lovely daughter". 
                         That shit goes right to the radio 
                         man.

                                     RAY
                         Uh huh. Well, how 'bout gettin' us 
                         some real equipment?

                                     MANAGER
                         Listen, I sign you guys to a five 
                         year management contract and you got 
                         it all. Equipment. Demo. A truck

                         percent record deal. Wherever ya 
                         want to go babe, trust me, I'll get 
                         you there. Whatd'ya say?

                                     RAY
                              (exchanging looks 
                              with John)
                         We'll have a band meeting. The four 
                         of us do everything unanimously or 
                         we don't do it.

                                     MANAGER
                         The musketeers. I'm touched. But 
                         lemme tell you something -- loyalty 
                         don't pay the bills. Think about it. 
                         Call me tomorrow.

               He gives Ray a card, leaving, crossing to Jim and PAM talking.

                                     JOHN
                              (to Ray)
                         What a sleaze! Man, Jim's gotta start 
                         facing the crowd if he's gonna be 
                         the front man.

                                     RAY
                         He's just getting his confidence.

                                     JOHN
                         He never does what we rehearsed. 
                         What's the point of...

                                     RAY
                         How does it feel?

                                     JOHN
                         Great, but...

               Pam on payphone calling her friends to come.

                                     PAM
                         ...make sure you get Barb and Sue 
                         Anne to come. And tell them to ask 
                         for Jim!

               The MANAGER on his way out leaning into Jim's face, slyly.

                                     MANAGER
                         Jim, how old are you?

                                     JIM
                         Ah, twenty one...

                                     MANAGER
                         Jesus, you're a gold mine, I'll make 
                         it quick and to the point and if you 
                         repeat it I'll deny it -- drop these 
                         guys, I'll put you with some real 
                         musicians, your voice, your looks, 
                         that's what'll sell records, we'll 
                         make a million bucks. A year. Goodbye. 
                         Call me. I'm right. He gives Jim a 
                         card and goes. Pam disgusted with 
                         the type, Jim laughs, likes the guy.

                                     JIM
                         I like a man wears his soul on his 
                         face.

                                     RAY
                              (coming over)
                         "Whiskey's" next, I can feel it in 
                         my bones.

                                     ROBBIE
                         I still think the lyrics are weird.

               INT. LONDON FOG - NIGHT

               MONTAGE EFFECT -- Jim sings "A Little Game" on the Fog stage. 
               Super over WHISKEY sign.

               EXT. SUNSET STRIP -- THAT NIGHT

               CU moving down -- the "LOVE" is on the marquee at the famous 
               WHISKY A GO GO as we move down to see JIM, PAM, and the DOORS. 
               Jim jumps through the TEEMING TRAFFIC (horns, anger) right 
               in front of a COP CAR, crossing to a long line of teenage 
               FANS dying to get into the club.

                                     JIM
                              (to Ray, innocently)
                         Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted 
                         to fuck me, I could feel it for the 
                         first time!

                                     RAY
                         Right on stud. But you better watch 
                         out for the guys.

                                     JIM
                              (to the band)
                         Guys, I'm serious about the desert, 
                         we still gotta deepen man, we gotta 
                         take some peyote -- all of us 
                         together, we got one more stage to 
                         go...

                                     ROBBIE
                         I don't know man, fucks up my playing. 
                         I been playing music for 10 years 
                         man and this is the first time in my 
                         whole damned life I ever played it.

                                     JIM
                         Are you satisfied?

                                     JOHN
                         Will you get off my case! I'm never 
                         doing acid again. Too many bad trips 
                         man.

                                     JIM
                         It's not acid John, it's peyote. 
                         It's a bonding ceremony. It's got to 
                         be more... more... more...

                                     JOHN
                         I'm into TM man. I promised my guru...

                                     PAM
                         I want to! I want to! I'm ready. 
                         Let's go to the desert... do the 
                         peyote, the good peyote.

                                     JIM
                              (to girl in line)
                         Who's on now?

                                     GIRL 1
                              (withering look, very 
                              hip)
                         "Love".

                                     JIM
                         Yeah, Arthur Lee's cool.

                                     GIRL 1
                         They're the best... better'n the 
                         Beatles.

                                     JIM
                         You mean the Marx Brothers of music, 
                         we could blow 'em away.

               The GIRLS looking at each other like who is this jerk.

                                     GIRL 2
                         And who are you?

                                     JIM
                         The Doors... We're up the street at 
                         the Fog.

               Laughter from the GIRLS.

                                     GIRL 1
                              (contempt)
                         The Doors. I heard of you. That's 
                         the dumbest name. I wouldn't go to 
                         the Fog if you paid me.

                                     JIM
                         Oh yeah what would you do for money?

                                     PAM
                         Let's go Jim, come on.

               Meanwhile DENSMORE is hitting up on GIRL 2.

                                     JOHN
                         So you don't have a phone number? 
                         What do you mean you don't have a 
                         phone number?

                                     GIRL 2
                         I don't have a phone number. So give 
                         me your number then.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't have a phone.

               Robbie is doing his imitation of a shrimp for ANOTHER GIRL 
               who's laughing.

                                     GIRL 1
                              (intrigued, to Jim)
                         Well, would you leave my name at the 
                         door?

                                     JIM
                         Well I don't know. What's your name?

                                     GIRL 1
                         Caprice.

                                     JIM
                         Caprice? That's the dumbest name I 
                         ever heard.

               A look between Jim and Caprice. Pamela pulling Jim away, 
               gives the girl a look.

                                     JIM
                         Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do 
                         Anything! Raise your hands if you 
                         understand! Alive, any of you alive -- 
                         let's take a poll -- how many of you 
                         know you're really alive!!

               The crowd giggles. Jim climbs a pole, yells.

                                     JIM
                         No one? Raise your hands c'mon man... 
                         let's go.

               On the crowd. A few raise their hands, smile.

               We IRIS in on the Doors suddenly -- a strange sound -- REVERSE 
               IRIS on Jim -- feeling it now. The peyote.

               JIM's POV -- Pam irising out. This strange sound in his ears -- 
               a rattle of an Indian gourd, similar to what we heard in the 
               car in Arizona when Jim was a boy. Now a distant Indian drum 
               beating. The beginning strains of THE END dribble in.

               EXT. DESERT - DAY

               A dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping 
               up dustdevils.

               They're all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle somewhere 
               on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent 
               rocks and cacti...

               A football huddle of faces - RAY, JOHN, ROBBIE, JIM -- the 
               four DOORS... laughing with the first mad impulse of the 
               peyote.

               PAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to comfort 
               her on the edge of a cliff... Jim panthers up the dune.

                                     JIM
                         Everybody having a good time?

               They hug. She throws up again.

                                     JIM
                         ...awright, pretty good, it gets 
                         better.

               Jim holds his head. Feels the ride.

                                     JIM
                         WOA!! It's fast.

               JUMP CUTS: Jim and Pam are touching each other. Face. Shadows. 
               Sand falls from Pam's hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird. 
               "Hawk! Hawk!" Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune.

               Abruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors in a sense 
               torn between them and Pam. EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their faces, 
               their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their 
               teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part.

                                     JIM
                         When the serpent appears, his head 
                         is ten feet long and five feet wide. 
                         He has one red eye and one green 
                         eye. He's deadly and he's seven miles 
                         long. As he moves -- on his scales 
                         is written all the history of the 
                         world, all people, all actions, all 
                         of us our little pictures on the 
                         scales, God it's big! -- and it's 
                         eating as it moves all the time, 
                         devouring, digesting consciousness, 
                         power, a monster of energy!

               John shutters -- as does Robbie and Ray. Jim seems possessed.

                                     JIM
                         We must kiss the snake on the tongue, 
                         if it senses our fear, it will eat 
                         us instantly. But if we kiss it 
                         without fear, the snake will take us 
                         through the garden and out the gate. 
                         To our freedom -we must ride this 
                         snake. To the end of time.

               Pause. He has instilled a flux of fear in the group.

                                     JOHN
                         I think I'm fucked up. I'm not 
                         thinking right.

                                     JIM
                         You're fucked up John. Go with it, 
                         confusion is the sound of creation.

                                     JOHN
                         You should see your eyes right now, 
                         you're death. Look at your eyes -- 
                         you're crazy man, you look crazy. 
                         You scare me.

                                     JIM
                         No no no John John. God is crazy 
                         too. God is part insane as well as 
                         sane. Not in control all the time. 
                         Dionysus was the God of the wine. He 
                         made ecstasy but he also made madness. 
                         Madness is all right. That's what 
                         you want, isn't it, isn't it? Where's 
                         that joint?

                                     ROBBIE
                              (crying)
                         I get scared thinking of all the 
                         choices inside. I could go. I could 
                         stay. I can live anywhere. I could 
                         die now if I wanted. It's limitless 
                         choice... and no one cares.

                                     JIM
                         Die Robbie.

                                     JOHN
                         What the fuck!

                                     PAM
                              (wandering in)
                         I don't know what I am. I'm on the 
                         cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn. 
                         Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn 
                         domestic and safe, so I don't know 
                         which one to be.

               Jim looking at her, smiles.

                                     JIM
                         I love you.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (into the same lens)
                         Oh my God, the light, it's so 
                         beautiful Ray. Can you see it... 
                         it's all one... honey?

               Ray has his head buried in his hands.

                                     RAY
                         I'm in pain man. I want something 
                         from the peyote. I feel the universe 
                         functioning perfectly but I'm still 
                         perfectly locked inside myself. 
                         Instead of Oneness, I feel total 
                         Isolation. Aloneness. Fear... Pain... 
                         Jim, all I feel is pain.

                                     JIM
                         Pain makes me feel more alive Ray. 
                         Pain is meant to wake us up. People 
                         try to hide their pain but they're 
                         wrong.

                                     JOHN
                         I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything 
                         I can, and I know it will never be 
                         enough.

                                     JIM
                              (whispers)
                         Pam wants you.
                              (normal)
                         You're a good Catholic John, you 
                         want it so you can feel guilty about 
                         it... Fuck death away John.

                                     ROBBIE
                         I feel Fear... so bad I just numb 
                         out all my feelings. I'm afraid of 
                         my father, I'm afraid of Yahweh... I 
                         wish I could play my guitar.

                                     JIM
                         Maybe you should kill your father 
                         Robbie. He tried to kill you. Kill 
                         him!

                                     ROBBIE
                         I'm so fucking scared.

                                     JIM
                         But you're Alive! It's beautiful! 
                         Fear, pain, lust, we've got to know 
                         all our feelings before we can come 
                         out the other side free men. Don't 
                         feel ashamed of yourselves, don't 
                         let society destroy your reality. 
                         Our freedom's the only thing worth 
                         dying for, it's the only thing worth 
                         living for!

               He takes Ray and Robbie's hands, his voice calming them, 
               reform the circle. John hesitant. Not all will enter the 
               gates at evening.

                                     JOHN
                              (cold sweats)
                         I'm not gonna make it man. I'm scared 
                         Jim, I'm still scared. Blindness is 
                         coming on.

                                     JIM
                         Then use us John, use our strength, 
                         it's us four now, a tribe of warriors, 
                         everything we have comes from the 
                         same source, the great Creator of 
                         Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the 
                         snake. . . I promise you I will be 
                         with you till the end of time.

               Pulling John into the circle, bonding, their four heads sunk 
               to the desert floor, Jim making wild Indian sounds, deep-
               throated "shoooh... shoooh"... now humming a song from the 
               desert.

                                     JIM
                         My wild love went riding... mmmmmm. 
                         She rode all the day. She ride to 
                         the devil. And ask for him to pay... 
                         shooo shoooo

               The OTHERS join in his chant, the four rising and falling 
               like a collective breath.

                                     JIM
                              (ad lib)
                         ...she went to the desert she went 
                         to the sea Joseph we did see...

               Suddenly Jim breaks and rises out of the circle. Ray, Robbie, 
               John, all looking at him. The same need. Pamela, the 
               desperation of her eyes.

                                     JIM
                              (to himself)
                         ...I'm lying to you. I am scared.

               He goes, his boots in the sand.

                                     JOHN
                         Jim, where are you going.

                                     JIM
                              (looking back)
                         I'll be back. I gotta go alone.

               Pamela calling from another dune, far away.

                                     PAM
                         Jim! Jim... come here, dance... don't 
                         go away.

               His POV -- of her, receding. She screams for him. He's in 
               pain. Cannot help her.

               A BIRD of prey in the sky.

               Jim moving across a lunar landscape. SPECIAL EFFECT: The sun 
               is black like night or else white in a black sky. Voices in 
               the distance. "Jim, where are you going?" A mother's voice, 
               a father's voice.

               DOORS SONG 
               Can you picture what will be 
               So limitless and free 
               Desperately in need of some stranger's hand in a desperate 
               land 
               Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain and all the children are 
               insane: waiting for the summer rain

               FLASHBACKS

               INT. CAR - MOVING - DESERT

               JIM, 4, in the back of a car in the desert -- looking back...

               At the overturned truck, the bodies in the road... at the 
               older Indian looking at him... finally at the dying Indian... 
               his eyes.

               INT. MORRISON HOME - DAY

               Somewhere. The child alone. On the living room floor. Drawing 
               his sketches in a book. MOM's feet moving past -- then DAD'S 
               feet. We may sense a subtle shift in mood when the parents 
               come in -- from the boy's eyes which never leave the sketch 
               he is drawing.

               EXT. DESERT - DAY

               An OLD WOMAN is beckoning to him from an opening in the face 
               of the mountain... then she's gone.

               JIM bounds towards the crevice.

               INT. ROCK PALACE - DAY

               He is in an isolated cathedral of rocks. The CRONE, muttering, 
               leaving through another crevice. Suddenly a MOUNTAIN LION is 
               visible, stretched hugely across a rock. It growls 
               ferociously, upset, and suddenly shoots out the back of the 
               cave. Silence.

               Jim, thunderstruck, gaping. A gallery of ancient INDIAN 
               PETROGLYPHS surround him on all sides. Curious, oblong 
               figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the 
               hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deities 
               proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of 
               Creation.

               Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities -- 
               staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face...

               DOORS SONG 
               There's danger on the edge of town 
               Ride the King's highway 
               Weird scenes inside the gold mine 
               Ride the King's highway west, baby

               The sound of a rattle -- "shichishichi" -- he realizes he's 
               being watched. By what? He whips his eyes everywhere. A large 
               LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly, tatters of 
               a former skin clinging to its throat, spits a forked tongue 
               and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull... Now the 
               sound of the Bull-Roarer, whipping the air, announcing the 
               appearance of the shaman.

               Jim's struck with an overwhelming sense of... awe... ancient 
               mysteries. He turns. The lizard is looking at him.

               The GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him. We are 
               looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of light, 
               some headdress, a sense of skins... music drops back, no 
               lyrics... the voice is old, familiar, possible Spanish descent 
               dialect or huararchi.

                                     INDIAN GHOST VOICE
                         ...you are a prince among white men, 
                         yet you are a warrior among us. You 
                         are ready now. Go out "walk with the 
                         pain of the world, travel to the end 
                         of the wind" -- and change it for 
                         all men as you were born to do.

               The voice, the pretense, -- the glow too quickly fades -- 
               leaving Jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he 
               knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen -- and once you 
               have seen, it will never be the same again. His eyes.

               EXT. CAVE - DAY

               JIM exits the cave.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT. WHISKY A GO GO - NIGHT

               EXTREME CLOSE on JIM'S EYES as he continues with THE END.

               DOORS SONG 
               Ride the snake 
               Ride the snake, to the lake 
               The ancient lake 
               The snake is long, seven miles 
               Ride the snake 
               He's old, and his skin is cold

               Camera pulling out from his eyes. There's something different 
               tonight. Something in the air. His eyes are open, he's facing 
               outward, gripping the mike for his life, hair falling in his 
               face, dripping sweat, we sense all his soul concentrated in 
               what he has to say.

               Cliques of GROUPIES have staked claims at the foot of the 
               stage, eyes fucking him as he writhes, spreading his legs. 
               Every twitch, every moment he sucks out the tension on the 
               musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his 
               audience.

               Nobody is moving in the club. The DANCERS are still, the GO 
               GO GIRLS in their white plastic boots and dresses hang 
               motionless in their gilded cages. Even the WAITRESSES have 
               stopped, frozen with their trays, denying something is going 
               to happen.

               PAMELA, DOROTHY... JERRY from the Fog, also the manager of 
               this place, watches from the balcony, shaking his head, 
               doesn't understand. Panning to two RECORD TYPES with him -- 
               JAC HOLZMAN, distinguished six footer, suit, and PAUL 
               ROTHCHILD, funky, pigtailed, ex-con, early 30s.

                                     JIM & DOORS
                         The west is best (2) 
                         Get here and we'll do the rest 
                         The blue bus is calling us (2) 
                         Driver where you taking us?

               The band has come together fully now. ROBBIE'S fingers sliding 
               across the trembling strings, staring at the ceiling, 
               wandering around the darkened portions of stage left, he 
               feels Jim -- echoes him back with his flamenco-blues guitar.

               JOHN on drums, reading Jim's moods, throws in the spontaneous 
               and violent riffs that keep it savage. He literally tortures 
               Jim's ears with his drums.

               And RAY, concentrated with his nodding head like a big 
               flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves, 
               yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with the 
               messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. There is 
               something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how to 
               play Jim.

               And JIM -- "that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal" -- 
               ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the 
               world, to live out the words of the Indian prophet... to 
               lead.

                                     JIM
                         The killer awoke before dawn 
                         He put his boots on 
                         He took a face from the ancient 
                         gallery 
                         And he walked on down the hall

               Ray looks over up from his board, catches Robby with a 'what's 
               this?' look... They go with it, improvising...

               Jim clutching the mike tighter, seeking solace in its arms; 
               it all hangs in the air as if he doesn't have any idea what 
               he's going to say next.

                                     JIM
                         He went to the room where his sister 
                         lived 
                         And he paid a visit to his brother 
                         And then he went on down the hall...

               Pamela sensing something is coming... the AUDIENCE... Jerry... 
               the go-go dancers...

                                     JIM
                         And he came to a door, And he looked 
                         inside "Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want 
                         to kill you".

               FLASH -- A FATHER'S FACE, any face, older, any man...

                                     JIM
                         Mother... I want to...

               FLASH -- A MOTHER'S FACE, any face, older, a woman

                                     JIM
                         AAAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHH 
                         YOOOOOUUUUUUUUUU!!!!! FUCK YOU ALL 
                         NIGHT!

               The SCREAMS primal, pure Jim -- Indian savagery ripped from 
               the depths of his soul, of his pain -- bouncing off the 
               walls...

               As the AUDIENCE gasps, shocked, stunned...

               As the guitar hits a high, horrid reverb, JIM in slightly 
               SLOW MOTION suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted 
               and shoots violently backwards, hitting the floor like a 
               puppet cut from his string -- we sense Jim himself has crossed 
               a barrier now, gone into yet another stage of his performance, 
               a stage from which he can never return. Like the gunfighter 
               who has killed his first man.

               RAY sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! Robbie 
               and John follow. the instruments EXPLODE all at once trying 
               to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream.

               The CLUB in shock. Tribal taboo broken in one instant. Jerry 
               exploding off the balcony toward the stage...

               Pamela, extremely moved and impressed, and Dorothy... the go-
               go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... the 
               groupies love it.

               Jim has jumped up now, dancing an Indian war dance around 
               the mike.

                                     JIM
                         Come on baby take a chance with us 
                         (X3) 
                         And meet me in the back of the blue 
                         bus

                         Doona blue yeah! 
                         Come on yeah!

               INT. BACKSTAGE WHISKY HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

               JIM is being muscled out the door by JERRY, livid.

                                     JERRY
                         NOBODY'S GONNA FUCK THEIR MOTHER ON 
                         MY STAGE! YOU'RE OUTTA HERE. You 
                         don't ever come back to play, you 
                         don't ever come back to drink -- 
                         You're DEAD ON THE STRIP!

                                     JIM
                              (ranting back at him)
                         Kill the father, fuck the mother, 
                         kill the father, fuck the mother -- 
                         that's what I'm into! That's what 
                         I'm into!

               Jerry pinning Jim to the wall,

                                     JERRY
                         You -- MORRISON! You're fucking filthy 
                         twisted perverse punk, get back to 
                         your fucking sewer!!

                                     JIM
                              (calmly smiling)
                         You have the face of a pig man.

               Lost in the melee, RAY and JOHN springing Jim back from likely 
               death

                                     RAY
                         JERRY JERRY... He was talking about 
                         Oedipus! GREEK TRAGEDY!! It's ART!!

                                     JERRY
                         FUCK ART!! GET THE FUCK ART OUT!!!

               Pushing, shoving, scrambling. Past a long-haired JOURNALIST 
               yelling into a payphone.

                                     JOURNALIST
                         NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE DOORS -- 
                         NEVER!! GET A PHOTOGRAPHER DOWN HERE. 
                         "ROLLING STONE'S GOTTA SEE THIS!!

               As they rumble by him, all yelling at once. Into the street.

               EXT. ALLEY & STAIRCASE OUTSIDE WHISKY - THAT NIGHT

               The DOORS go sailing out, followed by one of their drums, 
               JOHN and ROBBIE restraining Jim from going back in.

                                     JIM
                         TAKE A LONG LOOK OLD MAN. WE ARE THE 
                         FUTURE. WE ARE THINGS TO COME.

                                     JERRY
                         FUCK YOU... YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD!

               Wanting to come after Jim but restrained now by the RECORD 
               MOGULS, HOLZMAN and ROTHCHILD.

                                     PAUL
                         Come on Jerry, cool it, cool it... 
                         he's a kid, it's a song about dying, 
                         changing...

               JAC HOLZMAN pushing past to Ray. Pamela separating Jim 
               visually from Jerry.

                                     JOHN
                              (to RAY and ROBBIE)
                         We'll never work again man. The Mafia 
                         controls all these clubs.

                                     HOLZMAN
                              (to Ray and Robbie)
                         Quite a night! Hi, I'm Jac Holzman. 
                         I own Elektra Records.

                                     RAY
                              (knows the name)
                         Oh sure, hi.

               Holzman pauses, a dramatic presence, six foot two, impeccably 
               dressed, he knows the weight of his words.

                                     HOLZMAN
                         Listen... I think if you could just 
                         put what you did in there on record, 
                         we could really have something... 
                         and we could make a lot of money...

               It hangs there. Impossible words.

                                     RAY
                         Yeah?

               John and Robbie sharing looks.

                                     HOLZMAN
                              (pointing to ROTHCHILD 
                              coming up)
                         Yeah... and Rothchild here was born 
                         to be your producer.

                                     ROBBIE
                              (recognizing Paul)
                         Hey, the guy that did Butterfield!

                                     PAUL
                         Bertold Brecht, cabaret and rock. 
                         Give me a fucking break. You guys 
                         are amazing! Let's go make a record.

                                     JIM
                              (to Ray, pointing 
                              back at Jerry)
                         Hey, is that asshole gonna pay us?

                                     HOLZMAN
                              (amused)
                         Why don't you go inside and ask him 
                         Jim?

               Strains of LIGHT MY FIRE cross the cut.

               INT. SUNSET SOUND RECORDING STUDIO - DAY (1966)

               Four-track TAPE SYSTEM is rolling.

               DOORS SONG 
               You know that it would be untrue 
               You know that I would be a liar 
               If I was to say to you 
               Girl, we couldn't get much higher

               Camera moving fast thru the control room, past the ENGINEER 
               (BRUCE BOTNICK), taciturn, 20's, the PRODUCER (PAUL ROTHCHILD) 
               in pig heaven, and the owner JAC HOLZMAN in his blue suit 
               watching.

                                     PAUL
                         Hey Bruce, you feel it?

                                     BRUCE
                         I'm having big fun.

                                     PAUL
                              (to Jac)
                         I got goosebumps Jac. This is history 
                         going down here. An album of killer 
                         music in six days... six days... 
                         unreal!

               Camera moving fast past a smiling PAM watching, out to the 
               DOORS on the floor, jamming... on to JIM in the vocal booth, 
               headphone to his ears.

                                     JIM
                         Come on baby, LIGHT MY FIIIRRRREEEE!!!

               The song, now fully -- orchestrated, rolling on over the 
               following MONTAGE:

                                     JIM
                              (after song)
                         Pretty good! Pretty neat!

               EXT. GOLDEN GATE PARK - SAN FRANCISCO (DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE) - 
               DAY (1967)

               LIGHT MY FIRE continues.

               DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of the "Human Be-In", the "Summer of 
               Love" -- swarming FLOWER CHILDREN, WAR PROTESTORS.

               A staged 16mm. grainy shot of JIM and PAMELA, RAY and DOROTHY, 
               JOHN, ROBBIE and their TWO NEW GIRLFRIENDS wandering thru 
               the CROWD sharing the spirit. Pam and Jim fool around -- 
               laughing -- tickling each other for the home movie camera 
               shot by Ray... Pam is goofy, makes funny faces, teases him 
               running a flower under his nose, thru his hair, then trips 
               him. He chases her across the lawn.

               INT. FILLMORE WEST STAGE - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (1967)

               The CROWD is "beautiful" -- candles, incense sticks, flowers, 
               vibes of peace and love. The instrumental of "Light My Fire" 
               is playing, but only three DOORS are on stage till Jim comes 
               swinging across on a rope like tarzan all the way across the 
               stage -- then drops down, rebounds lithely and hits the mike.

                                     JIM
                              (singing)
                         The time to hesitate is through 
                         No time to wallow in the mire.

               JIM swandives into the stoned crowd with the mike at the 
               instrumental section, a colored spotlight flecking him, GIRLS 
               kiss him. The guys want to be him, the girls want him -- and 
               he knows it, teasing and tantalizing them...

                                     JIM
                         Try now we can only lose 
                         And our love become a funeral pyre 
                         Come on baby, light my fire 
                         Try to set the night on 
                         FIIIIIIIIIRE!!!!!

               BODYGUARDS running in to pull him out as he's tossed, like a 
               limp god, over the heads of the crowd, rolling like a buoy 
               on a rocking sea, from hand to hand, Dionysus, devoured limb 
               from limb by the "little girls".

               PAMELA watching from the side curtain.

               ALABAMA SONG (WHISKY BAR) now kicks in with its comic, 
               Brechtian strain as we:

               OMIT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY

               Screaming FANS chase the DOORS to a commercial airplane, 
               scribbling autographs. One of the GIRLS smacking JIM on the 
               lips as he laughs, her cameras clicking. PAMELA shooting a 
               home movie of it, pushed aside by the crowd, rescued by ROBBIE 
               and the new young manager, BILL SIDDONS...

               DOORS SONG 
               Oh show me the way to the next whisky bar 
               Oh don't ask why 
               Oh don't ask why

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE (SEEN FROM PLANE) - DAY

               The City as seen by:

               INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

               JIM'S face pressed to the window, PAMELA next to him hugging 
               each other.

                                     JIM
                              (real close, hugging 
                              her)
                         I don't mind dying in a plane crash, 
                         a smile on my face.

                                     PAMELA
                              (cutting his food)
                         As compared to what?

                                     JIM
                         I just don't want to go out slow -- 
                         brain tumor, botulism. I want to 
                         feel what it's like, cause death is 
                         only going to happen to you once.

                                     PAMELA
                         I don't want to die ever, what a 
                         weird thing to say.

               DOORS SONG 
               For if we don't find the next whisky bar 
               I tell you we must die 
               I tell you 
               I tell you 
               I tell you we must die

               EXT. CBS - NEW YORK - NIGHT (SUMMER, 1967)

               A LIMOUSINE pulling up in front of the Ed Sullivan Marquee. 
               The sidewalk is mobbed with FANS, mostly YOUNG GIRLS.

               DOORS SONG 
               Oh moon of Alabama 
               We now must say goodbye 
               We've lost our good ol mama 
               We must have whiskey oh you know why

               INT. LIMO - NIGHT

               JIM looking out at the MOB with the other DOORS and PAMELA. 
               The look on his face is ironic.

               His POV -- the YOUNG GIRLS' FACES, arms grasping at the 
               windows like tentacles of a poisonous hydra, their faces 
               deformed by SILENT SCREAMS (we hear faint strangled shrieks 
               below the song)... POLICE and SECURITY pressing them back, 
               linking arms to clear a path for the Doors.

               DOORS SONG 
               Show me the way to the next little girl 
               Oh don't ask why 
               Oh don't ask why

               The GIRLS crying hysterically as Jim lazily, leopardly, moves 
               across the CROWD, almost like Oswald waiting for the Ruby 
               bullet but with that sweet, pleasant smile on his face, dark 
               glasses concealing...

                                     GIRLS
                              (faint)
                         Oh Jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, I looove 
                         youuuuu, Jimmmmmm, pleeeeeaase, 
                         Jimmmmm, here, sign miiiine... take 
                         a picture Jim?... Jim, Jim, oh please 
                         look at me Jim!!

               Their voices distorting. A GIRLCHILD squeezing thru the cordon 
               with the fatal bullet. In slightly SLOW MOTION, Jim seeing 
               her come... as she glues herself hip to hip, lip to lip with 
               Jim, her hands clawing at his leather pants. It takes TWO 
               COPS to peel her off. Pamela furious. Jim is gracious with 
               everyone, signs patiently, talks, kisses, shakes hands with 
               the boys, lets them touch his hair, his body, poses for a 
               picture, seems to like it.

               DOORS SONG 
               For if we don't find the next little girl 
               I tell you we must die 
               I tell you 
               I tell you 
               I tell you we must die

               INT. CBS BACKSTAGE - THAT EVENING

               The nervous PRODUCER, HERB, leading "MR. SULLIVAN" thru the 
               corridor to the Doors' DRESSING ROOM past several "ACTS" 
               getting ready to go on... animals, tumblers, a soprano 
               wailing...

                                     PRODUCER
                         Right this way Mr. Sullivan. They're 
                         called "the Doors". They got the 
                         number one single in the country -- 
                         "Light Your Fire".

                                     SULLIVAN
                         "Light Your Fire"? Is that sooo?

                                     PRODUCER
                         They look pretty grungy but we're...

               INT. DOORS DRESSING ROOM - EVENING

               Bedlam. MAKE-UP ARTISTS pancaking the faces of the DOORS -- 
               the nightmare coming true. RAY in a white suit with too many 
               pinstripes. ROBBIE a spearmint turtleneck, beads, long 
               sideburns, JOHN in red velveteen head to foot with a tie-dye 
               splotch on the front of it. Their hair's being violated enough 
               by a nervous gay black HAIR DESIGNER to make them totally 
               self-conscious and nervous about their first live TV 
               appearance -- all except JIM who remains in his signature 
               black leather with the silver navajo belt and shiny spangles -- 
               watching a portable TV... A GIRL leaving his side, crossing 
               Pamela. Eye contact between them speaks of Pamela's jealousy.

                                     JOHN
                              (indignant)
                         You're gonna cut it!

                                     HAIRDRESSER
                              (doing John)
                         No, I'm going to worship it. What 
                         kind of shampoo are you using?

                                     JOHN
                         The kind you get in hotels.

                                     HAIRDRESSER
                         Pamper yourself sweetheart, you don't 
                         want split ends, you're a celebrity 
                         now.
                              (moving to Ray)
                         You have very serious-serious hair, 
                         it needs to rebel. I'll give it a 
                         tinge of something freaky.

                                     RAY
                         I'd rather stay the same color.

                         What about me?

               TELEVISION INSERT -- images of DETROIT burning, summer of 
               67.

                         riots this hot summer!

               On JIM, as they pancake him, reflective.

                                     JIM
                         No wonder "Light My Fire's" number 
                         one.

                              (friendly)
                         The biggest mistakes in my life have 
                         been haircuts.

                         Don't wash it. Don't set it. He likes 
                         it the way it is...

                         All right, be mean...

               Commotion from the doorway as the PRODUCER leads the lock-
               jawed MR. SULLIVAN in with everyone bowing and scraping to 
               the Pope.

                                     PRODUCER
                         Boys -- meet Mr. Sullivan

               Mr. Sullivan waves from the doorway.

                                     SULLIVAN
                         Hi boys, heard your song "Light That 
                         Fire"
                              (Herb corrects)
                         ...think you're great... good luck 
                         out there.

                                     DOORS
                              (ad lib)
                         Oh thanks Mr. Sullivan.

                                     PRODUCER
                              (moving alongside Ray)
                         Well the guys at Network have told 
                         us they have a small problem with 
                         the lyrics "girl we couldn't get 
                         much higher". You can't say "higher" 
                         on network so they asked if... you 
                         could say, "girl we can't get much 
                         better"... can you dig that?

               A look from the guys. Jim sullen. Tension in the air. Mr. 
               Sullivan waiting.

                                     JIM
                         How 'bout, "girl you couldn't bite 
                         my wire".

               Pause. The producer puzzled a beat. It doesn't go down.

                                     PRODUCER
                         I don't think Standards and Practices 
                         would...

               Sullivan exiting, waving at no one in particular like Nixon 
               would.

                                     SULLIVAN
                         Look, you boys don't forget to smile 
                         now. Don't be so sullen out there...

                                     JIM
                         Uh well, we're kind of a sullen group, 
                         Ed.

               SIDDONS reassuring the Producer.

                                     SIDDONS
                         We'll work it out Herb, promise. 
                         Give me five.

                                     PRODUCER
                              (not totally convinced, 
                              exiting)
                         Groovy! Uh you boys should know Mr. 
                         Sullivan is considering you boys for 
                         four more shows. You dig?

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         Well?

                                     JIM
                         What -- are we the Beatles now John?

                                     RAY
                              (laughs)
                         It's only a word man. The Stones 
                         changed...

                                     JIM
                         Hey Ray, why don't you change your 
                         name to Sid or Irving Manzarek or 
                         something... it's only a word y'know.

                                     ROBBIE
                         It's my words. I don't care, let's 
                         just jam.

               Ray's seething tension. Younger brother starting to get out 
               of hand.

               INT. STUDIO STAGE - THAT NIGHT

               SULLIVAN stiffly introducing them.

                                     SULLIVAN
                         Now here on our stage direct from 
                         Los Angeles, California, ladies and 
                         gentlemen, The Doors!

               The lights come up on the DOORS in their ultimate nightmare -- 
               each Door appearing consecutively in a lightspot as Jim sings 
               the ubiquitous "Light My Fire", trapped in this Elvis Presley -- 
               Vegas act, he looks like he couldn't care less. DOORS hang 
               suspended everywhere on the set -- their name spelled out in 
               big block standup letters.

               Jim has a hard-on in his pants, barely concealed by his tight 
               leathers.

                                     PRODUCER
                              (in control booth)
                         What's that?... oh Jesus!... get off 
                         it!! Where's he going?

               Jim misses his marks deliberately, the camera having a hard 
               time following him.

                                     JIM & DOORS
                         You know that it would be untrue 
                         You know that I would be a liar 
                         If I was to say to you 
                         Girl, we couldn't get much higher 
                         Come on baby light my fire

                              (hyperventilating)
                         He said it! He said it! On National 
                         TV You can't do that! You can't do 
                         that!!! You blew it you little shit! 
                         You'll never play Ed Sullivan again.

               Jim on the monitors, singing through to his freedom, falls 
               on the floor flat, the camera missing him completely.

                                     JIM
                         Come on baby, light my fire 
                         Try to set the night on FIIIIRRRRRE!

               INT. HOTEL BEDROOM -- NEW YORK - NIGHT

               OVERHEAD ANGLE -- JIM lies there in a sweat. PAMELA pulls 
               off him, naked, frustrated, trying to rouse him.

                                     PAM

                         What can I do, what do you want me 
                         to do?... Jim?

                                     JIM
                         I don't know... I guess I should see 
                         a doctor or something... maybe I 
                         should go to someone of the straight 
                         Jungian philosophy.

                         It happens to other guys too...

               Jim, quietly pissed, reaches for the whiskey bottle at the 
               side of the bed.

                                     JIM
                         It's so scary up there. To be adored. 
                         Isn't that irony? Teenage death girls 
                         want my dick -- a mere clown -- not 
                         my words. I'll never wake up in a 
                         good mood again... Lament for my 
                         cock, a tongue of knowledge deep in 
                         the feathered night, gives life, 
                         soar and crucify, I seek to know 
                         you...

                         It's not so complicated Jim, it's 
                         just sex, y'know.

                         you're a poet, not a rock star. Ed 
                         Sullivan's not a place for you.

                         know what poetry is? Where is the 
                         feast they promised us? Where is the

               He grabs her. They lurch, smashing the lamp. WILD CHILD song 
               kicking in.

               Camera running at them from the end of the room. JIM laughs 
               manically as they roll off the bed into a wall. Kicking, 
               hitting hard.

               A VOICE across the wall joining in, banging.

               More nagging. By this time the fight has expired of its own

               They giggle, start to laugh. Then they cuddle on the floor, 
               in the corner, in this semi-lit New York hotel room.

               hotel suite overlooking CENTRAL PARK... to the DOORS in 
               armchairs surrounded by an informal group of a DOZEN 
               JOURNALISTS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS... JIM behind dark shades 
               drinking long Hawaiian fruit punches, decked out in snakeskin.

                         What are your songs about Mr. 
                         Morrison?

               TIME DISSOLVES over the questions and answers. A vaguely 
               dreamy quality.

                         Uh love death travel... revolt. We 
                         all write the songs, we're interested 
                         in anything about disorder, chaos, 
                         especially activity which seems to 
                         have no meaning... I think when you 
                         make peace with authority, you become 
                         authority.

                         the audiences' fantasies, obeying

                         are destructive, I'm destructive. 
                         It's kinda like sucking the puss out

                         rock and roll's like Greek drama or 
                         caveman stories. The audience comes 
                         to see ancient rituals in ancient 
                         caves. Their souls in jeopardy. 
                         They're not watching any longer, 
                         they're participating -- and 
                         everything's in play, your life,

               their looks. The backbeat of CRYSTAL SHIP, dreamy hazy, Warhol-
               like interview floating over the room like a giant mushroom 
               cloud.

                                                             DISSOLVING TO:

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                              (more down to earth)
                         Mr. Morrison, how do you feel about 
                         being called the "ultimate barbie 
                         doll".

               On Jim -- a beat. A sickly smile spreads.

                                     JIM
                         I guess when you say something like 
                         that, it's a shortcut to thinking.

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                         Then do you "think" about the dreadful 
                         reviews your new poetry book has 
                         gotten?

               Holding up a copy of "The Lords and New Creatures".

                                     JIM
                              (softly)
                         I guess they didn't understand.

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                              (having scored)
                         And it's true you financed it's 
                         publication?

               Jim motions him over, whispers something at SIDDONS who goes 
               to fetch a pair of scissors.

                                     RAY
                              (angry)
                         Have you bothered to read the poetry 
                         ma'm? You keep denying that anything 
                         good can come from L.A., I mean isn't 
                         that kind of a provincial attitude? 
                         That Bob Dylan's the only poet cause 
                         he's from the East Coast, but you 
                         won't even look past Jim's goddamn 
                         looks at the words man!

                                     JIM
                              (embarrassed)
                         Hey c'mon Ray, hate should be allowed.

                                     JOURNALIST 1
                         ...but what really are your songs 
                         about Mr. Morrison? You preach, 
                         "saving the planet", "making a new 
                         age" but how does drinking, taking 
                         drugs, this boozy sort of apocalyptic 
                         stance at the world influence young 
                         people in a positive way?

                                     JIM
                         I like that -- "boozy apocalyptic" -- 
                         you're a word man, but how does your 
                         newspaper influence young people to 
                         think about Vietnam? Who's sending 
                         the soldiers over there to die? The 
                         establishment -- right? Your newspaper -- 
                         right? That seems to me a lot more 
                         dangerous than the stuff we do.

                                                           DISSOLVING OVER:

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                         Do you believe in drugs Mr. Morrison?

               SIDDONS comes back in, hands Jim a pair of scissors.

                                     JIM
                              (graciously disdainful)
                         Did you know Nietzsche said, "all 
                         good consciousness, all evidence of 
                         truth comes only from the senses"? 
                         Hey you wanna arm wrestle? Come on, 
                         you look pretty tough today. C'mon, 
                         I'll take you all on.

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                              (ignoring his smile)
                         And alcohol? Is that considered part 
                         of the shaman's wisdom?

                                     JIM
                         Part of the clown's wisdom -- it's 
                         kinda the American way. You know we 
                         spend more on alcohol and tobacco 
                         than on education.

               DOUBLE IMAGES on the DISSOLVES.

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                         Are you by any chance in a trance 
                         now Mr. Morrison?

                                     JIM
                         Do you hurt?

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                         What?

                                     JIM
                         What hurts you the most?

               He cuts his hair with the scissors. A commotion.

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                         What are you doing?

                                                           DISSOLVING OVER:

                                     JIM
                         Uh... got tired of the barbie doll 
                         look. It hurt.

                                     JOURNALIST 3
                         Are you serious?

                                     JIM
                              (cutting hair blindly)
                         About? Y'know when people are joking, 
                         I find they are dead serious and 
                         when they're dead serious, I find 
                         them funny.

               They're amazed. The point is made however -- visibly. The 
               anger in his action is so extreme yet so contained -- the 
               cynosure of all eyes as always. Eyes shooting back at 
               JOURNALIST 3... JOURNALIST 4 cuts in from the back of the 
               room altering the mood.

                                     JOURNALIST 4
                         What do your parents think about 
                         what you are doing?

                                     JIM
                              (pause)
                         Actually, I don't really remember 
                         being born. It musta happened during 
                         one of my blackouts.

               Laughter. JOURNALIST 4 with dark hair and demeanor, gypsy-
               like jewelry on her arm and avant garde clothing, large 
               glasses, is probably a rock magazine writer but seems to 
               like Jim and his work.

                                     JOURNALIST 4
                         But they must've expressed some 
                         feeling?

                                     JIM
                              (pause)
                         Well, to be honest they're not living 
                         anymore so I don't like to talk about 
                         that.

               Flashbulbs hitting his face at that moment.

                                     JOURNALIST 4
                         Could you at least tell us how they 
                         died?

               Jim puts the scissors down, going to a low mysterious voice.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, it was a... horrible car crash... 
                         in the desert in the fifties, 
                         Arizona... ran right into a truckload 
                         of Indians... Navajos, they were 
                         lying out on the road, all bleeding, 
                         and I was with my Grandma and Grandad, 
                         we were banged up and all... and I 
                         was looking at my Dad and he was 
                         lying there... but his throat was 
                         severed and there was air coming 
                         out.

               He puts the room in a hush. He has mesmerized them and they're 
               not sure whether to believe it or not.

                                     JOURNALIST 4
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JOURNALIST 2
                         I have the feeling I'm being put on.

               Jim rises, staggers slightly as he makes his way to the bar 
               on the way out of the room, smiles right at her, ignoring 
               everybody else in the room.

                                     JIM
                         Y'all believe what you want to 
                         believe, you will anyway... but it 
                         does kinda show you what excites 
                         people?
                              (looking directly at 
                              her)
                         Fear, pity, horror -- all those good 
                         things that count. It's sorta I guess 
                         like being on the edge of an orgasm, 
                         y'know... that mystery just before 
                         you come. When? If? Should I? Will 
                         you die for me, eat me, this way, 
                         the end...

               He goes. The room in silence, embarrassed, nervous titters 
               looking at Journalist 4 who flushes deeply as we cut to:

               INT. PATRICIA'S SOHO LOFT - THAT DAY (RAIN)

               Rain, rain, rain... pelting the large windows as we glide to 
               JIM fucking JOURNALIST 4 (PATRICIA KENNEALY) madly in the 
               twisted sheets...

               He gives up, exhausted. The SONG CRYSTAL SHIP backbeats the 
               scene...

               He wanders around her place. Her place is crammed with books 
               and intellectualabilia, skulls, candles, globes of the world, 
               plants. She puts her glasses back on.

                                     PATRICIA
                         You want to do some more cocaine? 
                         It'll loosen you up.

                                     JIM
                         Great! A new thing.

               As she goes to a bowl of cocaine, laid alongside a bottle of 
               champagne and a basketful of items all catered by Jim. He's 
               at her bookcase, thumbing through an ancient manuscript.

                                     JIM
                         Wow how old is this?

               INSERT -- the DRAWINGS in the book pertain to Witchcraft.

                                     PATRICIA
                              (snorting)
                         14th Century. I practice the Craft.

                                     JIM
                         The Craft?

                                     PATRICIA
                         I'm a witch
                              (smiles)
                         A white one.

                                     JIM
                              (impressed)
                         Wow! You Patricia? Who would've 
                         guessed?

               Ironic of course when you look at her long dark locks and 
               demeanor. She looks back at him, challenging.

                                     PATRICIA
                         The Kennealy's were Celtic cheiftains 
                         and pre-Christian shamans when your 
                         Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a 
                         minor Scottish clan founded by a 
                         bastard son of the king of Norway.

               JIM reappraising her. Her eye contact is very direct.

                                     PATRICIA
                         It's a religion, witchcraft. Witches 
                         are the protectors of the seasons, 
                         the harvests, goddesses of the grain. 
                         And when crossed, destroyers.

               Jim waits. Something in the feeling of the room has shifted. 
               The sound of her razor chopping coke. He snorts -- the first 
               time.

                                     PATRICIA
                         You ever try drinking blood?

                                     JIM
                         What?

                                     PATRICIA
                         It works you know. You drink blood 
                         the right time of the moon... they 
                         used to dance in the forests naked. 
                         I think that's what offended the 
                         Puritans and led to the Burnings. 
                         They were a sexual threat to their 
                         male order like the Bacchae -- five 
                         days a year for Dionysus, they used 
                         to wander the hills in ancient Greece, 
                         the first witches, clans of wild 
                         women fucking, looting, eating animals 
                         raw, the wine in their blood running 
                         hot -- looking for Dionysus... to 
                         tear him to pieces -- isn't that 
                         wild?

               Jim is down on his knees crawling around her. She is crawling 
               back.

                                     JIM
                              (hooked)
                         Where do you get the blood?

               Patricia laughs.

                                                        SUPERIMPOSITION TO:

               PATRICIA drawing blood from her arm -- wipes it on his mouth. 
               Some of it spills out, tamping the white powder with red 
               stains. Jim watching enthralled, coked out. She hands him 
               the jewelled Moroccan dagger.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Blood is the rose of mysterious union, 
                         symbol of potency... now you.

                                     JIM
                         No... I don't like... cutting myself.

               He extends his arm. The look between them. He closes his 
               eyes like a little boy. She makes the cut.

               naked to music, drinking champagne.

               JUMP CUT: He is chasing her with one of her goat horns between 
               his legs. They wrestle, yell, lusty bacchanale.

               They're fucking madly on the wooden floor of the loft, bathed 
               in blood and white powder all over the place, rain pelting 
               the windows, thunder, Orff's "Carmina Burana" cutting in 
               over the Doors' song.

                         Come on rock god, fuck me, fuck me 
                         good.

               In slightly ape-like SLOW MOTION, he's wildly thrusting at 
               her like a stallion, then reaches down, yanks out her 
               diaphragm -- holds it to her eyes briefly and throws it across 
               the room into the fireplace.

                                     JIM

                         Come on...

               Incants him to climax with CELTIC WORDS.

               Jim is wild, reaching for the Moroccan dagger, holding it to 
               her face as he continues to pump.

               shoulders. She's shooting rapidly talking him thru the trip. 
               Her sentences falling on separate cuts of Jim. As we hear 
               the backbeat of PEOPLE ARE STRANGE.

               He resists, he goes with it, push pull, prowling her loft on 
               the acid, a bottle of cognac in one hand -- changing from 
               shot to shot like a chameleon, free, wild, vicious, obscene.

               A weird dance ensuing between them -- teasing, enticing. He 
               runs away, writhes along her wall, being photographed inch 
               by moving inch. He crawls to her. She gets down with him on

                                     JOHN
                         Get outta here man. This is fucking 
                         weird man.

               The PR MAN is still next to Jim, jumping up and down excitedly 
               waving across the room at nothing in particular. As the 
               PHOTOGRAPHERS try to get Jim and the Doors in a photo 
               opportunity.

                                     PR MAN
                         Right this way Jim. Andy's in the 
                         bedroom.

                                     JIM
                              (to RAY)
                         Don't go, y'see Norman Mailer, I 
                         hear he's here?

                                     RAY
                         Yeah can we meet him, he's great... 
                         just like he is.
                              (enamored)
                         You wanna meet him?

                                     JIM
                              (paranoid)
                         I don't know... did he know who you 
                         were?

                                     RAY
                         Yeah sure, he's cool, come on, he's 
                         your hero!

                                     JIM
                         Nah... later...

               A wasted, emaciated Edie Sedgewick type floats into Jim's 
               fractured POV -- introducing a MAN with a crew cut and silk 
               suit.

                                     EDIE
                              (echoey voice)
                         Hey Jim, this is Jake Johnson, you 
                         remember Jake Johnson -- the 
                         astronaut, he's just got back from 
                         outer space.

                                     JAKE JOHNSON
                         I like the Doors, I like the Doors, 
                         I like the Doors.

                                     JIM
                         I like outer space.

               Tom Baker brings a tall, incredible looking BLONDE in black 
               leather towards him.

                                     TOM
                         Hey where's my joint?
                              (a roach goes back)
                         There's this chick sings with the 
                         Velvet Underground, Andy's band. She 
                         says she can drink you under the 
                         table.

               They stare at each other like two cats. Eye level stares 
               that go on and on. She finally hisses in a German accent.

                                     NICO
                         I'm Nico. It's boring tonight. Some 
                         of us are going downtown to a new 
                         club. You want to come?

               A voice to kill, looks to undress, fully as tall as Jim.

                                     TOM
                              (distantly heard)
                         ...elevate your taste in trolls man.

                                     JIM
                              (to Nico who reaches 
                              for her vodka)
                         Vodka? Race you.

                                     NICO
                         Your death...

                                     JIM
                              (to Ray and Robbie)
                         Wanna go?... Come on let's go.

                                     ROBBIE
                         She looks too freaky to me.

                                     NICO
                         Wait just a minute.

               As she floats away.

                                     JIM
                         Come on there's pussy Robbie.

                                     ROBBIE
                              (excited)
                         Hey I met this chick Lynne, she wants 
                         to be alone.

               Lynne is there, pretty, nods to Jim.

                                     RAY
                         Come on Jim, let's go.

                                     JIM
                              (childlike)
                         Don't you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol?

                                     JOHN
                         Tell you the truth, I can live without 
                         him. He's a freak. Let's get outta 
                         here. We got a show tomorrow.

                                     JIM
                         Come on man! I thought we were gonna 
                         be a band, the four of us -- and 
                         party all night, rock and roll!

                                     RAY
                              (laughs)
                         I could never keep up with you Jim. 
                         I couldn't make the music.

               Jim's eyes briefly on -- Pamela giggling with the French 
               Count, putting her hand on his arm as she laughs. Innocent, 
               nothing meant but a moment...

                                     JIM
                              (desperate mockery, 
                              grabs Ray)
                         Don't go. Don't leave! You can't 
                         leave. I don't know what will happen. 
                         It might be Death.

                                     RAY
                         Come on Jim, this isn't our scene, 
                         these people are vampires. We gotta 
                         stick together man, the four of us. 
                         Let's make the myths man.

               A moment, strange. Slightly SLOW MOTION. Ray tapping Jim's 
               shoulder goodbye... Robbie and John's faces passing on. As 
               if they're parting -- in a symbolic way. Jim blinking in the 
               same SLOW MOTION, looking. Nico is gone -- but Tom is there, 
               across the room, waving.

               The INDIAN SHAMAN looks like he's standing there in a corner. 
               Jim, ripped, heads for him, but the PR WOMAN cuts him off. 
               Jim forgets he saw the Indian.

                                     PR MAN
                         Right here Jim, right here. Andy's 
                         waiting. You know what you have in
