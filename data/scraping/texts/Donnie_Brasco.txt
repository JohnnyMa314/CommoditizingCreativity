    c arpet-- Fed eral blue .
    CLENDON HOGUE, 40s, barrel chest, shrewd eyes over half-moon glasses,
    PRESIDES behind a vast desk. The impressive mien of earned
    authority. Before him:
    JULES BONOVOLONTA, late 40s, Green Beret veteran, SUPERVISOR, 140
    pounds of pugnacity and gristle. Ex-street agent cramped by

                           LEBOW
                A reliable wire.
                           JULES
                A fiction writer.
    Hogue peruses SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of Sonny Red and Sonny Black. Then
    reads the INFORMANT'S REPORT.
                          MARSHALL
                is that the 209, sir?
                          LEBOW
                There's going to be a war between
                Sonny Red and Sonny Black--it's
                all over the streets.
                           JULES
                Clarence, you couldn't find the
                streets with an asphalt detector.

                            JULES
                 That's doesn't mean it's tonight.
                            LEBOW
                 Even if it's not tonight--and I ' m
                 not saying it's not tonight--it
                 could still be tonight because it
                 could be any night.
                        JULES
             Fuck you, Clarence.

             guys killing each other?       .

             An agent. Undercover.
                        HOGUE
             Then why are you depending on an
             informant? What does the agent
             say?
                   (off awkward looks)
             When's the last time you spoke to
             him?

             He checks in every three weeks?

             He checks in when he checks in,
             sir.

                  You got two cars. One's longer.
                  All things being equal, the
                  longer car is the one gonna get
                  there first.
                             LEFTY
                  Ain't the question all things
                  being equal. One's a Cadillac
                  and one's a Lincoln.

                  The one's longer gets there

                  That's right. And I told you
                  there's no comparison.

28   INT. THE PAST.      PISTONE HOME
     Donnie SHAVES his moustache in the bathroom. Sounds of the FRONT
     DOOR unlocking and then closing downstairs.
                             MAGGIE (O.C.)
                  Joe?
                             DONNIE
                  Up here.

     as she heads up the stairs...

               I had no idea you were coming
               home. I'm supposed to go to the
               movies tonight with the Grants.
     She enters the bathroom as he wipes the shaving cream off his face.
     He looks up, half his moustache SHAVED OFF. Her face FALLS.
                             MAGGIE
                 Oh, Joe, don't--
                       (beat)
                 Forget it.
                           DONNIE
                 What's the matter?
                             MAGGIE
                 I liked your moustache. It's the
                 only thing I liked about this
                 thing of yours.
                             DONNIE
                 Well, what do you want me to do
                 now?
                           MAGGIE
                 I want you to ask me.

                  Berada to get a message to you
                  that I like your moustache?
                             DONNIE
                  That's not the point.

     She jockeys for room at the mirror to put on her makeup.

                  They were supposed to pick me up
                  five minutes ago.

     Agitated, he starts to compulsively organize the medicine chest, the
     shelves.

               Where is everybody? I didn't say

     Lefty glares at Donnie--ACCUSES him with his eyes: who told you to
     come in here? Donnie sits down--something in the placid atmosphere
     that tells him: this is how it happens. Nicky peers over as Boobie
     writes on the SCOREPAD.

                   The loansharking predicates are
                   very specific. It's really

70   INT. NIGHT.    PISTONE HOME--MINNESOTA
     The door unlocks, and Donnie tiptoes into the house. The middle of
     the night. Goes into the kitchen for a snack. Opens the
     refrigerator.
     A BIRTHDAY CAKE
     half-eaten, with the elided legend, "HAPPY SWEET SIXTEEN, TERRY." He
     missed the party.
                           DONNIE
                Shit.

71   INT. NIGHT.   TERRY'S ROOM
     Terry lies awake. A shaft of light hits her face as Donnie opens the
     door.

               Terry ? You awak e?

               I ' m sorry I missed your party.
                         TERRY.
               It's okay. Uncle Bob flew in.
                          DONNIE
               I ' m not the kind of guy that
               breaks his promises.
                           TERRY
               That's what Mom said.
                          DONNIE
               I'm sure that's only part of what
               Mom said.
                         TERRY
               That's between you two.

               She was worried something
               happened to you.

                quit. That's how I live my life.
                I just had no way of knowing it
                would go this far.

               You're getting grown-up now. I

                          TERRY
               Half the kids in school don't

               That's not what I meant.
                          DONNIE
               Maybe I'm not there for the good
               times, but I'm there if you need
               me.
                          TERRY
               I know that, Dad.
                         DONNIE
               It's just another six months.
     "Another six months." That phrase. Like a knife in her heart.
                         TERRY
               Whenever. It's no big deal.
                         DONNIE
               Come here. Give me a hug.

     Donnie convenes a FAMILY MEETING over breakfast. Terry, Kerry and
     Maggie sit, sullen, around the kitchen table. Sherry runs down the
     stairs, sits down.
                           SHERRY
               Sorry I ' m late.
                               DONNIE
               Okay. I called this family
               meeting because there's something
               we have to t alk a bout. I kn ow
               what I'm doing involves a lot of
               sacrifice from everyone, but this
               is something patriotic for the
               country that you can all be proud
               of.

               I called the meeting because
               we're gonna have to move.
                              TERRY
                  I ' m not moving.
                               DONNIE
               This isn't a democracy, Terry.
               This is a dictatorsh ip. And
               that's my decision. It's getting
               too dangerous.
                          MAGGIE
               Well, I don't want to move

               There's too many people here who
               know us.
                         MAGGIE
               Those people are known as
               'friends,' Joe. You told me when
               we started this that we'd be
               moving back close to the family.
               That was the deal.

               Minnesota's great. Lakes and

         Sonny and Donnie stand in the bow, look out over the water.
                                   SONNY
                     You can live your life like a man
                     d own here. I bet if you took m y
                     blood pressure right now it'd be
                     down o ne hundre d per cent . Sonny
                     Red's got Jersey and we got
                     Florida, and Florida's better
                                                            '
                     than Jersey, right?
                                DONNIE
                     He can stick Jersey up his ass.
                                   SONNY
                     This is a great idea I had,
                     Florida.
                                   DONNIE
                     Once Lefty arranged it with
                     Trafficante--
                                   SONNY
                     Fuggedaboudit. What Lefty don't
                     understand is guys like
                     Trafficante, their day is done.

                  A 70 year old brain can't compare
                  with guys like us, because where
                  he's got like 20 more years
                  experience .in his day, we got 50
                  more years in our day. And we're
                  l iving in our day. C apeesh?
                            DONNIE
                  Simple arithmetic.
                            SONNY
                  Lik e wit h jea ns, who h ad th e
                  idea with ^eans and now look how
                  much money they're making?
                              DONNIE
                  Some young guy.
                            SONNY
                  Lefty's a dynamite-guy, no
                  q uesti on. But y ou kn ow, t he
                  thing with him is. . . he's trying
                  to help you but he hurts you. He
                  gets those two or three wines in
                  him...
                            DONNIE
                  You just gotta take it with a
                  grain of salt.
                         SONNY
               The books open up in December,
               I'm gonna propose you. You know                         <
               what that means?
                            DONNIE
               Fuggedaboudit. Be a made guy?
               That would be unbelievable.
                            SONNY
               What I'm saying is this. You
               don't have to report to Lefty no
               more. From now on you can report
               to me.
     CLOSE ON--DONNIE
     as he calculates the advantages and dangers of his new offer...
     IN THE STERN
     Lefty broods, nurses a spritzer. Watches Donnie with eyes full of
     anger and resentment. Boobie sidles up to him.

                  Can I ask you something? Did you
                  get this boat or did Donnie get
                  this boat?
                            LEFTY
                  Some broad down here he used to
                  know, it belongs to her brother.
                            BOOBIE
                  He knows a lot of broads, Donnie.
                            LEFTY
                  If Donnie had a dollar for every
                  broad of all his broads, he could
                  buy the fucking boat himself.
                            BOOBIE
                  If Donnie's got so many broads,
                  how come we never seen none of
                  them?
                            LEFTY
                  He uses them broads like Kleenex.
                  He won't spend a dollar to take
                  a lady out.
     Boobie drinks, takes a beat.
                            BOOBIE
                  You ever notic   e Donnie'11 buy
                  guns from you,    if you're offing
                  guns, but you    never see him be
                  the one offing    guns?
     Lefty thinks a beat.
