               EXTERIOR - SKY - DAY

               The camera is moving toward an Indian city. We are high and 
               far away, only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer and 
               nearer, and through the passing clouds these words appear:

               "No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is 
               no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include 
               each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What 
               can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and 
               to try to find one's way to the heart of the man..."

               And now we are approaching the city, the squalor of the little 
               shanty dwellings around the outskirts, the shadows of large 
               factories... And as we move nearer, coursing over the parched 
               terrain, the tiny fields of cultivation, strands of sound 
               are woven through the main titles, borne on the wind, images 
               from the life we are seeking:

               British: "Who the hell is he?!", lower class British: "I 
               don't know, sir."... "My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. 
               Gandhi."... A woman's voice, tender, soft: "You are my best 
               friend, my highest guru... and my sovereign lord."... A man 
               (Gandhi): "I am asking you to fight!"... An angry aristocratic 
               English voice: "At home children are writing 'essays' about 
               him!"... the sound of massed rifle fire, screams...

               EXTERIOR - CITY - DAY

               And now we are over the city, coming in toward a particular 
               street in the affluent suburbs of New Delhi... there are a 
               few cars (it is 1948), and we are closing on a milling crowd 
               near the entrance to one of the larger homes.

               We see saris, Indian tunics, a sprinkling of "Gandhi" caps, 
               several tongas (two-wheeled, horse-drawn taxis)... the shreds 
               of sound continue -- American woman, flirtatious, intimate: 
               "You're the only man I know who makes his own clothes." 
               Gandhi's laugh... The sound of rioting, women's cries and 
               screams of terror... An American voice: "This man of peace"...

               And as the titles end we begin to pick up the sounds of the 
               street... an Australian and his wife, a BBC correspondent... 
               all in passing, as the camera finally closes and holds on 
               one young man: Godse.

               BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Godse steps from a tonga as the crowd begins to move toward 
               an entrance-way at the back of a long wall.

                                     HOUSE SERVANT'S VOICE
                         He will be saying prayers in the 
                         garden -- just follow the others.

               In contrast to those about him, there is tension in Godse's 
               face, an air of danger in his movements.

               He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed 
               in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another tonga 
               that pulls up just behind his. Two young men (Apte and 
               Karkare) meet Godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of 
               imminent danger.

               They descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes 
               watching the crowd.

               Sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little 
               distance down the street an elderly man (Prakash) with a 
               short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a 
               cadaver is watching...

               Apte and Karkare look back at him. There is just the slightest 
               acknowledgment and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, 
               as though to tell them to be about their business.

               THE GATE AT BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who 
               nonchalantly flank the entrance. He stiffens himself, 
               cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then 
               glances back at the stoic face of Prakash. Prakash's gaze is 
               as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. Godse turns back, 
               wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a 
               group going through the gate.

               GARDEN - BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - TWILIGHT

               A fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling 
               the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- 
               some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the 
               great man.

               Godse moves forward through them toward the front just as 
               hushed voices begin to remark -- "I see him." "Here he comes!" 
               "Which one is Manu?"...

               Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a 
               little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people 
               watching.

               Featuring Gandhi. We see him distantly through the crowd. 
               The brown, wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl, 
               still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary 
               spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand nieces, 
               his "walking sticks," Manu and Abha.

               We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only 
               glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes 
               with some of the crowd and the two young women who support 
               him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to 
               someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand 
               on the shoulder of each of the girls.

               The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is 
               always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half 
               obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. We 
               hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with 
               shots of Godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of Apte 
               and Karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with 
               sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the 
               presence of danger.

               Featuring Godse. He slides through to the very front rank. 
               His breathing is short and there is perspiration around the 
               sides of his temples. And now, for an instant we see Gandhi 
               close from his point of view. He is only a few steps away, 
               but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu 
               half obscures him.

               Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face -- then he 
               moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking 
               a vessel for incense from her hands.

                                     MANU
                              (gently)
                         Brother -- Bapu is already late for 
                         prayers.

               Ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, Godse joins his 
               hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma.

               And now we see Gandhi in full shot. The cheap glasses, the 
               nut-brown head, the warm, eager eyes. He smiles and joins 
               his hands together to exchange Godse's greeting.

               Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer 
               to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires 
               point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice... 
               thrice.

               Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls.

                                     GANDHI
                         Oh, God... oh, God...

               Amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to

               KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Close shot. Soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half-
               step, step of the requiem march...

               Full shot. The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as 
               have never been seen on the screen massed along the route. 
               People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, 
               trees -- and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege 
               it reveals more and more... and more. All are silent. We 
               only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an 
               occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors 
               lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly 
               endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy 
               and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the 
               body of Gandhi.

               And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, 
               surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief 
               and reverence.

               THE COMMENTATORS' ROSTRUM - KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - 
               DAY

               Commentators from all over the world are covering the 
               ceremony. We concentrate on one, let us say the most 
               distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward R. 
               Murrow, who sits on the makeshift platform, a microphone 
               marked "CBS" before him, describing the procession as 
               technicians and staff move quietly around him.

                                     MURROW
                              (clipped, weighted)
                         ...The object of this massive tribute 
                         died as he had always lived -- a 
                         private man without wealth, without 
                         property, without official title or 
                         office...

               KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - DAY

               As the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the 
               marching soldiers, of the faces of Sikhs, and Tamils, Anglo-
               Indians, Moslems from the north, Marathas from the south, 
               blue-eyed Parsees, dark-skinned Keralans...

                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER
                         Mahatma Gandhi was not a commander 
                         of great armies nor ruler of vast 
                         lands, he could boast no scientific 
                         achievements, no artistic gift... 
                         Yet men, governments and dignitaries 
                         from all over the world have joined 
                         hands today to pay homage to this 
                         little brown man in the loincloth 
                         who led his country to freedom...

               We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi 
               as it slowly inches its way along the Kingsway.

               Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head 
               of dignitaries from many lands... and behind them a broad 
               mass of Indians. For a moment we see their sandalled feet 
               moving along the roadway and realize their quiet, rhythmic 
               shuffling is the only noise this vast assemblage has produced.

                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER
                         Pope Pius, the Archbishop of 
                         Canterbury, President Truman, Chiang 
                         Kai-shek, The Foreign Minister of 
                         Russia, the President of France... 
                         are among the millions here and abroad 
                         who have lamented his passing. In 
                         the words of General George C. 
                         Marshall, the American Secretary of 
                         State, "Mahatma Gandhi had become 
                         the spokesman for the conscience of 
                         mankind..."

               In the crowd following the bier we pick out the tall, English 
               figure of Mirabehn, dressed in a sari, her face taut in a 
               grief that seems ready to break like the Ganges in flood. 
               Near her a tall, heavy-set man, Germanic, still powerful of 
               build and mien though his white hair and deep lines suggest 
               a man well into his sixties (Kallenbach). He too marches 
               with a kind of numb air of loss that is too personal for 
               national mourning.

               On the edge of the street an American newspaperman (Walker) 
               watches as the bier passes him. He has been making notes, 
               but his hand stops now and we see the profile of Gandhi from 
               his point of view as the weapon-carrier silently rolls by. 
               It is personal, close. Walker clenches his teeth and there 
               is moisture in his eyes as he looks down. He tries to bring 
               his attention to his pad again, but his heart is not in it 
               and he stares with hollow emptiness at the street and the 
               horde of passing feet following the bier.

                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER
                         ...a man who made humility and simple 
                         truth more powerful than empires." 
                         And Albert Einstein added, 
                         "Generations to come will scarce 
                         believe that such a one as this ever 
                         in flesh and blood walked upon this 
                         earth."

               The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier 
               with Gandhi's body... the stout, blunt, but now shattered 
               Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face 
               of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves... and 
               finally Pandit Nehru -- a face with the strength of a hero, 
               the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a 
               loving father.

                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER
                         ... but perhaps to this man of peace, 
                         to this fighter who fought without 
                         malice or falsehood or hate, the 
                         tribute he would value most has come 
                         from General Douglas McArthur: "If 
                         civilization is to survive," the 
                         General said this morning, "all men 
                         cannot fail to adopt Gandhi's belief 
                         that the use of force to resolve 
                         conflict is not only wrong but 
                         contains within itself the germ of 
                         our own self-destruction."...

               A news truck is parked in the mass of the crowd. As the 
               cortege nears, the photographers on it stand to snap their 
               pictures. There is a newsreel crew center. The camera features 
               a woman photographer (Margaret Bourke-White) who sits with 
               her legs dangling over the side of the truck, her famous 
               camera held loosely in her hand, un-regarded, as she watches 
               the body of Gandhi approach. The intelligent features are 
               betrayed by the emotion in her eyes. For an instant we see 
               Gandhi from her point of view, and read the personal impact 
               it has on her.

                         Perhaps for the rest of us, the most 
                         satisfying comment on this tragedy 
                         comes from the impudent New York PM 
                         which today wrote, "There is still 
                         hope for a world which reacts as 
                         reverently as ours has to the death 
                         of a man like Gandhi."...

               The camera is high and we see the cortege from the rear, 
               moving off down the vast esplanade, its narrowing path parting 
               the sea of humanity like a long trail across a weaving 
               plain... and as the shuffling sound of sandalled feet fades 
               in the distance we dissolve through to

               RAILROAD - SOUTH AFRICA - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

               With the camera high we see a railroad track stretching out 
               across a darkly verdant plain, and suddenly the whistle of a 
               train as its engine and light sweep under the camera, 
               startling us as it sweeps across the moonlit landscape.

               Tracking with the train. We begin at the guard's van, dwelling 
               for a moment on the words "South African Railways," then 
               pass on to the dimly lit Third Class coaches in the rear of 
               the train, moving past the crowded Blacks and Indians in the 
               spare wooden accommodation... There are two or three such 
               coaches, then a Second Class coach... cushioned seats, better 
               lighting, a smattering of Europeans: farmers, clerks, young 
               families. Their clothes indicate the date: the early 1890s.

               The conductor is working his way through this coach, checking 
               tickets... The track continues to the First Class coach -- 
               linen over the seats, well-lit luxurious compartments. We 
               pass a single European, and then come to rest on the back of 
               a young Indian dressed in a rather dandified Victorian attire, 
               and reading as a Black porter stows his luggage.

               FIRST CLASS COACH - SOUTH AFRICAN RAILWAYS - INTERIOR - 
               NIGHT

               Featuring the young Indian. It is the young Gandhi -- a full 
               head of hair, a somewhat sensuous face, only the eyes help 
               us to identify him as the man we saw at Birla House, the 
               figure on the bier in Delhi. He is lost in his book and there 
               is a slight smile on his face as though what he reads 
               intrigues and surprises him. He grins suddenly at some 
               insight, then looks out of the window, weighing the idea.

               As he does the European passes the compartment and stops 
               dead on seeing an Indian face in the First Class section. 
               The porter glances at the European nervously. Gandhi pivots 
               to the porter, holding his place in the book, missing the 
               European, who has moved on down the corridor, altogether. We 
               see the cover of the book: The Kingdom of God is Within You, 
               by Leo Tolstoy.

                                     GANDHI
                         Tell me -- do you think about hell?

                                     PORTER
                              (stares at him blankly)
                         "Hell!"

                                     GANDHI
                              (the eternal, earnest 
                              sophomore)
                         No -- neither do I. But...
                              (he points abruptly 
                              to the book)
                         but this man is a Christian and he 
                         has written --

               The porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his 
               point of view we can just glimpse the European talking with 
               the conductor.

                                     PORTER
                         Excuse me, baas, but how long have 
                         you been in South Africa?

                                     GANDHI
                              (puzzled)
                         A -- a week.

                                     PORTER
                         Well, I don't know how you got a 
                         ticket for --

               He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work. 
               Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him 
               so.

               The European and the conductor push open the door and stride 
               in.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Here -- coolie, just what are you 
                         doing in this car?

               Gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a 
               manner.

                                     GANDHI
                         Why -- I -- I have a ticket. A First 
                         Class ticket.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         How did you get hold of it?

                                     GANDHI
                         I sent for it in the post. I'm an 
                         attorney, and I didn't have time to --

               He's taken out the ticket but there is a bit of bluster in 
               his attitude and it is cut off by a cold rebuff from the 
               European.

                                     EUROPEAN
                         There are no colored attorneys in 
                         South Africa. Go and sit where you 
                         belong.

               He gestures to the back of the train. Gandhi is nonplussed 
               and beginning to feel a little less sure of himself. The 
               porter, wanting to avoid trouble, reaches for Gandhi's 
               suitcases.

                                     PORTER
                         I'll take your luggage back, baas.

                                     GANDHI
                         No, no -- just a moment, please.

               He reaches into this waistcoat and produces a card which he 
               presents to the conductor.

                                     GANDHI
                         You see, Mohandas K. Gandhi, Attorney 
                         at Law. I am going to Pretoria to 
                         conduct a case for an Indian trading 
                         firm.

                                     EUROPEAN
                         Didn't you hear me? There are no 
                         colored attorneys in South Africa!

               Gandhi is still puzzled by his belligerence, but is beginning 
               to react to it, this time with a touch of irony.

                                     GANDHI
                         Sir, I was called to the bar in London 
                         and enrolled in the High Court of 
                         Chancery -- I am therefore an 
                         attorney, and since I am -- in your 
                         eyes -- colored -- I think we can 
                         deduce that there is at least one 
                         colored attorney in South Africa.

               The Porter stares -- amazed!

                                     EUROPEAN
                         Smart bloody kaffir -- throw him 
                         out!

               He turns and walks out of the compartment.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         You move your damn sammy carcass 
                         back to third class or I'll have you 
                         thrown off at the next station.

                                     GANDHI
                              (anger, a touch of 
                              panic)
                         I always go First Class! I have 
                         traveled all over England and I've 
                         never...

               MARITZBURG STATION - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

               Gandhi's luggage is thrown onto the station platform. A blast 
               of steam from the engine.

               A policeman and the conductor are pulling Gandhi from the 
               First Class car. Gandhi is clinging to the safety rails by 
               the door, a briefcase clutched firmly in one hand. The 
               European cracks on Gandhi's hands with his fist, breaking 
               Gandhi's grip and the policeman and conductor push him across 
               the platform. It is ugly and demeaning. Disgustedly, the 
               conductor shakes himself and signals for the train to start. 
               Gandhi rights himself on the platform, picking up his 
               briefcase, his face a mixture of rage, humiliation, impotence. 
               The conductor hurls Gandhi's book at his feet as the train 
               starts to move.

               Gandhi picks up the book, looking off at the departing train. 
               A lamp swinging in the wind alternately throws his face into 
               light and darkness.

               His point of view. The Black porter stares out of a window 
               at him, then we see the European taking his seat again, 
               righteously. The conductor standing in the door, watching 
               Gandhi even as the train pulls out. Then the Second Class 
               coach, with people standing at the window to stare at Gandhi -- 
               then the Third Class coaches, again with Blacks and a few 
               Indians looking at Gandhi with mystification and a touch of 
               fear.

               Gandhi stands with a studied air of defiance as the train 
               pulls away -- but when it is gone he is suddenly very aware 
               of his isolation and looks around the cold, dark platform 
               with self-conscious embarrassment.

               A Black railway worker looks as if he would like to express 
               sympathy, but he cannot find the courage and turns away from 
               Gandhi's gaze, pulling his collar up against the piercing 
               wind.

               The policeman who pulled Gandhi from the train talks with 
               the ticket-taker under the gas-lit entrance gate, both of 
               them staring off at Gandhi.

               An Indian woman near the entrance sits in a woolen sari, her 
               face half-veiled. A small child sleeps in her arms, and there 
               is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet. She turns away 
               from Gandhi's gaze as though it brought the plague itself.

               MR. BAKER'S LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR - NIGHT

               Featuring Gandhi. As if a reverse angle from the previous 
               shot, he is angry, baffled, defiant.

                                     GANDHI
                         But you're a rich man -- why do you 
                         put up with it?

               We are in a large Victorian parlor in a well-to-do home. 
               Facing Gandhi are Khan, a tall, impressive Indian. Singh, 
               slighter and older than Khan, but wiry and looking capable 
               of physical as well as intellectual strength, and Khan's 
               twenty-year-old son, Tyeb Mohammed.

                                     KHAN
                              (a shrug)
                         I'm rich -- but I'm Indian. I 
                         therefore do not expect to travel 
                         First Class.

               It is said with a dignity and strength that makes the 
               statement all the more bewildering. Gandhi looks around 
               helplessly. We see Mr. Baker, a wealthy white lawyer, whose 
               home this is, poking at the fire, slightly amused at Gandhi's 
               navet.

                                     GANDHI
                         In England, I was a poor student but 
                         I --

                                     KHAN
                         That was England.

               Gandhi is holding a British legal document; he lifts it 
               pointedly.

                                     GANDHI
                         This part of "England's" Empire!

                                     SINGH
                         Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and 
                         see a successful Muslim trader. The 
                         South Africans see him simply as an 
                         Indian. And the vast majority of 
                         Indians -- mostly Hindu like yourself --
                              (there is a moment of 
                              blinking embarrassment 
                              from Gandhi at this 
                              mention of his own 
                              religion)
                         were brought here to work the mines 
                         and harvest the crops -- and the 
                         Europeans don't want them doing 
                         anything else.

               Gandhi looks at Mr. Baker almost in disbelief.

                                     GANDHI
                         But that is very un-Christian.

               Mr. Baker smothers a smile.

                                     TYEB MOHAMMED
                         Mr. Gandhi, in this country Indians 
                         are not allowed to walk along a 
                         pavement with a "Christian"!

               Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously.

                                     GANDHI
                         You mean you employ Mr. Baker as 
                         your attorney, but you can't walk 
                         down the street with him?

                                     KHAN
                         I can. But I risk being kicked into 
                         the gutter by someone less "holy" 
                         than Mr. Baker.

               He smiles, but his eyes show that it is no joke.

               Gandhi glances from one to the other them -- absorbing the 
               inconceivable. And then almost before our eyes his innocence 
               of the world fuses with his anger at the injustice of it 
               all.

                                     GANDHI
                         Well, then, it must be fought. We 
                         are children of God like everyone 
                         else.

                                     KHAN
                              (dryly)
                         Allah be praised. And what battalions 
                         will you call upon?

                                     GANDHI
                         I -- I will write to the press -- 
                         here -- and in England.
                              (He turns to Baker 
                              firmly)
                         And I will use the courts.

               He lifts the documents threateningly.

                                     SINGH
                         You will make a lot of trouble.

               Its tone is chilling, and Gandhi's firmness is shaken a 
               little.

                                     GANDHI
                         We are members of the Empire. And we 
                         come from an ancient civilization. 
                         Why should we not walk on the 
                         pavements like other men?

               The sturdy Khan is studying him with a look of wry interest.

                                     KHAN
                         I rather like the idea of an Indian 
                         barrister in South Africa. I'm sure 
                         our community could keep you in work 
                         for some time, Mr. Gandhi -- even if 
                         you caused a good deal of trouble.
                              (Gandhi reacts 
                              uncertainly.)
                         Especially if you caused a good deal 
                         of trouble.

               Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, 
               plainly frightened by the challenge, but just as plainly 
               determined to take it.

               MOSQUE - EXTERIOR - DAY

               We see a rather crudely stitched sign: "Indian Congress Party 
               of South Africa." Gandhi, now sporting a moustache, stands 
               with Khan and Singh near a fire that has been started in the 
               open area before the Mosque. A wire basket has been placed 
               on supports over the fire. Before them, a small crowd, mostly 
               Indian (Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims), but with a few Whites drawn 
               by curiosity. Gandhi whispers, trying to ignore the crowd.

                                     GANDHI
                         There's the English reporter. I told 
                         you he'd come.

               We see the English reporter waiting skeptically. Near him, 
               trying to be inconspicuous on the edge of the small crowd, 
               are five policemen (one sergeant and four constables). A 
               horse-drawn paddy wagon is drawn up beside them.

                                     KHAN
                         You also said your article would 
                         draw a thousand people.
                              (If the crowd numbers 
                              100 they're lucky.)
                         At least some of the Hindus brought 
                         their wives.

               We see five or six women in saris standing together.

                                     GANDHI
                         No. I asked my wife to organize that.

               We feature Gandhi's wife, Ba, standing at the front of the 
               women. She possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with 
               large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this 
               moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to 
               do that which she would rather not.

                                     SINGH
                              (alarmed)
                         Some of them are leaving...

               Gandhi wets his lips nervously. He glances with a little 
               apprehension at the police, then takes his notes from his 
               pocket and moves to the front of the fire. He holds up his 
               hand for attention. He forces a smile -- then starts reading --

                                     GANDHI
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, we have asked 
                         you to gather here to help us proclaim 
                         our right to be treated as equal 
                         citizens of the Empire.

               It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to 
               themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before 
               wandering off shrug and continue on their way. Gandhi is 
               unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder, but 
               just as colorlessly.

                                     GANDHI
                         We do not seek conflict. We know the 
                         strength of the forces arrayed against 
                         us, know that because of them we can 
                         only use peaceful means -- but we 
                         are determined that justice will be 
                         done!

               This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the 
               crowd, as though expecting a reaction. Three or four committed 
               supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert 
               that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them. 
               He glances nervously at Ba, who is embarrassed for them both 
               now. She wraps her sari more closely around her and her 
               expression is a wife's "I told you so" -- sufferance, 
               mortification and loyalty, all in one. Gandhi wets his lips 
               again -- and takes a square of cardboard from his pocket -- 
               his "pass."

                                     GANDHI
                         The symbol of our status is embodied 
                         in this pass -- which we must carry 
                         at all times, but no European even 
                         has to have.

               He holds it up. A constable glances at the police sergeant.

                                     GANDHI
                         And the first step to changing our 
                         status is to eliminate this difference 
                         between us.

               And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the 
               fire. The flames engulf it.

               The police sergeant's eyes go wide with disbelief. The crowd 
               murmurs in shock. At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the 
               dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his 
               speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so 
               startling a gesture. Even so, a constable glances at the 
               police sergeant again, "Do we take him?". The sergeant just 
               shakes his head, "Wait."

               Khan moves up to Gandhi as the tremor of reaction ripples 
               through the crowd.

                                     KHAN
                              (quietly)
                         You write brilliantly, but you have 
                         much to learn about handling men.

               He takes Gandhi's notes from him, and faces the crowd.

                                     KHAN
                              (the reading not 
                              fluent, but firm and 
                              pointed)
                         We do not want to ignite... the fear 
                         or hatred of anyone. But we ask you -- 
                         Hindu, Muslim and Sikh -- to help us 
                         light up the sky... and the minds of 
                         the British authorities -- with our 
                         defiance of this injustice.

               It is the end of the speech. He looks at the crowd. No one 
               knows quite what to do. Gandhi harumphs -- gesturing to a 
               shallow box Singh holds. Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather 
               lamely.

                                     KHAN
                         We will now burn the passes of our 
                         committee and its supporters. We ask 
                         you to put your passes on the fire 
                         with --

                                     POLICE SERGEANT
                         Oh, no, you bloody well don't!

               He has stepped forward with his constables, who have faced 
               the crowd, halting the tentative movements of the few 
               committed supporters toward the fire.

                                     POLICE SERGEANT
                         Those passes are government property! 
                         And I will arrest the first man who 
                         tries to burn one!

               He is facing the crowd. Behind him, Khan holds himself erect 
               and slowly takes his own card from his pocket. He holds it 
               aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket. 
               The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see 
               it dropped in the flame.

                                     POLICE SERGEANT
                         Take him away!

               He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and 
               marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to 
               the paddy wagon. As he passes the sergeant, the sergeant 
               takes his billy club, and faces the crowd, rapping the club 
               menacingly against his hand.

                                     POLICE SERGEANT
                         Now -- are there any more?!

               Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes 
               the box from Singh and moves to the fire. Ba holds her hand 
               to her mouth -- terrified. Again the crowd's reaction turns 
               the sergeant. Gandhi is at the fire. For a second, his eyes 
               lock with the sergeant's -- and then nervously, he takes a 
               card and drops it in the wire basket, and another.

                                     POLICE SERGEANT
                         You little sammy bastard -- I --

               He has leapt across the distance between them, knocking the 
               box from Gandhi's hands, sending the cards flying and shoving 
               Gandhi to the ground. He turns and faces the crowd angrily, 
               pointing the billy club threateningly.

                                     POLICE SERGEANT
                         You want that kind of trouble -- you 
                         can have it!

               Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him. Gandhi, on his 
               hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has 
               picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward 
               apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he 
               drops it defiantly in the basket. The sergeant's fury bursts -- 
               and he slams the billy club down on Gandhi's head. Gandhi 
               sags to the ground. Ba screams. She starts to run to him, 
               but the other women seize her.

                                     BA
                         Let me go!

               She fights loose, but one of the constables takes her firmly.

               The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, 
               his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is 
               picking up another card. The crowd watches. The newspaper 
               reporter watches. Ba stares in anguish. Gandhi lifts the 
               card. The sergeant stares at him, angry but his emotions 
               somewhat in control after the first blow.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Stop!

               An instant of hesitation, then Gandhi drops the card into 
               the basket. The sergeant almost stops, but he strikes again. 
               A quiver of distaste at his own act crosses his face as Gandhi 
               sags.

               Ba's anguished face is wet with tears. The newspaper reporter 
               stares without making notes. Khan, at the paddy wagon, watches 
               in wonder.

               Gandhi, his head bleeding badly now, rises to his knees -- a 
               breath and he gropes around the ground for another card. His 
               fingers finally clutch one.

               The sergeant stares, his face wracked with uncertainty and 
               confusion.

               Gandhi lifts the card and painfully holds it over the fire, 
               then drops it in the basket.

               The sergeant slams the billy club down again -- firmly, but 
               with a manifest reluctance. The crowd watches breathlessly, 
               the newspaper reporter stares. The sergeant draws a breath, 
               grasping the club, but he bites his lip as he sees Gandhi 
               lift his head feebly, his shaking hands, stained with his 
               own blood, groping for another card...

               GANDHI'S BEDROOM - SOUTH AFRICA - INTERIOR - NIGHT

               Ba is gently removing Gandhi's suit coat, staring fearfully 
               at a bandage on his head, another along the side of his face. 
               The room is gaslit, overfurnished in the Victorian manner. 
               Middle class. Gandhi sits carefully on the bed, where some 
               newspapers are spread out, English-language ones among them.

                                     GANDHI
                         You saved the papers.

               Ba reaches forth, gently touching the bandages on his head.

                                     BA
                         I wish you were still struggling for 
                         work in Bombay.

               Gandhi doesn't take his eyes from the papers, but he shakes 
               his head.

                                     GANDHI
                         I hated that -- all the pettiness, 
                         the little corruptions.
                              (A reflective grin.)
                         And I was more laughing stock than 
                         lawyer.

               He smiles whimsically, then turns back to the papers.

                                     GANDHI
                         But they needed me here. If I'd never 
                         been thrown off that train, perhaps 
                         no one would ever have needed me.

               Ba stares at the back of his head, wounded by that remark, 
               bearing it as stoically as he bore the blows against him.

                                     GANDHI
                              (reading)
                         "A high court judge has confirmed 
                         that Mr. Gandhi would have been within 
                         his rights to prosecute for assault 
                         since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted 
                         arrest." -- I told you about English 
                         law.

                                     BA
                         As I told you about English policemen.

               Before Gandhi can retort there is a knock on the door.

                                     GANDHI
                         Yes?

               A small, round ayah (an Indian nursemaid) pushes open the 
               door and proudly admits her charges, Gandhi's sons: Harilal 
               (ten), Manilal (six) and Ramdas (two). They are all dressed 
               in European suits, ties and stiff collars. They step forward, 
               one by one, making the pranam (the Hindu gesture of greeting), 
               then bending and touching the hands and lips to Gandhi's 
               feet in the traditional obeisance of child to father.

                                     HARILAL
                         We are glad to have you back, Bapu.

               Gandhi smiles.

                                     GANDHI
                         And I am glad to be back.
                              (He holds his hands 
                              out to Ramdas.)
                         Come...

               And Ramdas runs to him and Gandhi bends to kiss him as Ramdas 
               put his arms around his neck.

                                     BA
                         Be careful!

               Gandhi pats him indulgently, then carefully stands erect, 
               looking at them all with satisfaction.

                                     GANDHI
                         Tomorrow I will tell you what it 
                         feels like to be a jailbird.

               The two older boys show the expected apprehension -- and 
               interest. Gandhi nods to the ayah. She claps her hands 
               smartly.

                                     AYAH
                         Come. Come.

               The boys bow and leave like boys used to household discipline. 
               The ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter at they 
               go down the hall.

                                     GANDHI
                         Just like proper English gentlemen. 
                         I'm proud of them.

                                     BA
                         They are boys. -- And they're Indian.

               Gandhi is stretching out on the bed, taking up another paper.

                                     GANDHI
                         Hm. Will you take this off?
                              (he touches the bandage 
                              on his cheek)
                         It pinches every time I speak.

               Ba comes and sits down on the bed beside him, maneuvering so 
               that she can get at the bandage.

                                     GANDHI
                         Here, you see? Even the South African 
                         papers apologize -- "a monstrous 
                         attack."

                                     BA
                              (of the tape, as she 
                              is about to pull it)
                         Are you sure?

                                     GANDHI
                              (impatiently)
                         Yes -- I can't talk like this.

               Ba pauses and looks at him mischievously, as though that's 
               not a bad idea. He scowls at her, then recognizes her "joke" 
               and grins.

                                     GANDHI
                         Pull!

               Ba pulls one of the strands of tape and Gandhi flinches.

                                     GANDHI
                         Oww!

                                     BA
                              (mockingly)
                         Mr. Khan said they called you brave.

               Gandhi is nursing the moustache; he looks at her wryly.

                                     GANDHI
                         If you would let me teach you to 
                         read, you could see for yourself.

               She leans forward to pull at the remaining piece.

                                     BA
                         I could have told them you were merely 
                         foolish.

               Gandhi is watching her as she leans across him, her beauty 
               and proximity obviously stirring him.

                                     GANDHI
                         It proves what I told you. If I had 
                         prosecuted him as everyone advised -- 
                         even you -- they would have hated me -- 
                         by showing forgiveness I -- ouch!

               She has pulled the other piece.

                                     BA
                         There...

               And she slowly pries the gauze free from the strands of hair 
               above his lip. As she does Gandhi watches her more and more 
               intently, and slips his arms around her back.

                                     GANDHI
                              (as though continuing 
                              the argument)
                         You see there is such a thing as 
                         moral force -- and it can be 
                         harnessed.

               Ba examines the bandage and gently touches the wound, but 
               she is aware of his burning eyes and arms around her back.

                                     BA
                         Not always. You have told me twice 
                         now that you were giving up the 
                         pleasures of the flesh.

               It slows Gandhi uneasily for a moment and Ba must grin at 
               his discomfiture. He leans back -- still holding her, but 
               looking at the ceiling.

                                     GANDHI
                         I am. I am convinced the holy men 
                         are right. When you give up, you 
                         gain. The simpler your life the 
                         better.

               Ba makes a moue of acceptance and starts to pull free of him -- 
               but his arms still hold her. She smothers a smile and lies 
               down, her face next to his, but neither of them looking at 
               each other. A long beat... and then Gandhi turns his head. 
               She is aware of his eyes on her, but she doesn't move. Gandhi 
               leans forward and touches his lips to her neck.

                                     GANDHI
                         I will fast tomorrow -- as a penance.

               Ba smiles. Still not looking at him, she places her hand 
               behind his head, gently.

                                     BA
                         If you enjoy it a great deal you 
                         must fast for two days.

               Gandhi laughs... and buries her in love.

               STREET AND COURTYARD OF GOVERNMENT BUILDING - JOHANNESBURG - 
               EXTERIOR - MORNING

               General Smuts -- sitting erect and imposing on a beautiful 
               chestnut horse -- rides down a tree-lined street. He wears 
               civilian clothes with riding boots and breeches. Behind him, 
               a junior British officer rides as escort. He turns into the 
               entrance-way of an imposing building.

               The hooves of Smuts's horse clatter on the cobblestones as 
               the General rides into the courtyard. Two sentries come 
               smartly to attention. A stable boy rushes to take the horse, 
               and a tall civil servant approaches the General busily as he 
               dismounts.

                                     TALL CIVIL SERVANT
                         The London papers have arrived from 
                         the Cape, sir.

                                     SMUTS
                         Yes -- ?

               The tall civil servant checks his notes.

                                     TALL CIVIL SERVANT
                         The worst was the Daily Mail, sir. 
                         They said, "The burning of passes by 
                         Mr. Gandhi was the most significant 
                         act in colonial affairs since the 
                         Declaration of Independence."

               Smuts has given the reins to the stable boy.

                                     SMUTS
                         Did they? Well, they'll find we're a 
                         little better prepared this time. 
                         Mr. Gandhi will find he's on a long 
                         hiding to nothing.

               And he strides into the building, past the smartly saluting 
               sentries.

               GANDHI'S HOUSE - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - MORNING

               Gandhi comes from the house door. He carries a briefcase and 
               is still dressed in European clothes, though far less elegant 
               than we have seen him in before. His mien, the cut of his 
               hair, all suggest a passage of time. As he turns, he stops 
               because he is face to face with Charlie Andrews, a very tall, 
               thin Englishman, who wears a rumpled white suit and a clerical 
               collar. He has descended from a horse-drawn taxi that carries 
               his luggage. He too has stopped. For a moment they both 
               appraise each other, neither speaking. Then

                                     CHARLIE
                         You'd be Gandhi --
                              (Gandhi nods.)
                         ...I thought you'd be bigger.

                                     GANDHI
                         I'm sorry.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't 
                         matter.
                              (He suddenly steps 
                              forward and thrusts 
                              out his hand.)
                         I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie 
                         Andrews. I've come from India -- 
                         I've read a great deal about you.

                                     GANDHI
                         Some of it good, I hope.

               He turns and waves to the parlor window. The three boys are 
               there -- all bigger -- and Ba holds a new addition; they all 
               wave. And Gandhi turns back, and starts down the long, hilly 
               street.

                                     GANDHI
                              (to Charlie)
                         Would you care to walk?

               He gestures Charlie on and starts walking.

               Charlie nods uncertainly. He looks back at the cab in 
               confusion, then signals the driver to follow and hurries on 
               to match strides with Gandhi's brisk pace.

                                     GANDHI
                              (noting Charlie's 
                              collar)
                         You're a clergyman.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes. I've -- I've met some very 
                         remarkable people in India... and -- 
                         and when I read what you've been 
                         doing here, I -- I wanted to help.
                              (He looks at Gandhi, 
                              then smiles awkwardly.)
                         Does that surprise you?

                                     GANDHI
                         Not anymore.
                              (And now he smiles.)
                         At first I was amazed... but when 
                         you are fighting in a just cause, 
                         people seem to pop up -- like you -- 
                         right out of the pavement. Even when 
                         it is dangerous or --

               JOHANNESBURG SUBURB - EXTERIOR - MORNING

               They have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, 
               run-down. Ahead of them three youths (twenty, twenty-one) in 
               working clothes, carrying lunch boxes, lean indolently against 
               a building directly in their path. They react to the sight 
               of Gandhi -- fun. Then stride the pavement menacingly. One 
               of them tosses aside his cigarette.

                                     FIRST YOUTH
                         Hey -- look what's comin'!

                                     SECOND YOUTH
                         A white shepherd leading a brown 
                         sammy!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Perhaps I should --

               Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head.

                                     GANDHI
                         Doesn't the New Testament say, "If 
                         your enemy strikes you on the right 
                         cheek, offer him the left"?

               He starts to move forward. Charlie hesitates, then follows 
               nervously, more nervous for Gandhi than himself.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think perhaps the phrase was used 
                         metaphorically... I don't think our 
                         Lord meant --

               They are getting closer. The youths laughing, whispering.

                                     GANDHI
                         I'm not so certain. I have thought 
                         about it a great deal. I suspect he 
                         meant you must show courage -- be 
                         willing to take a blow -- several 
                         blows -- to show you will not strike 
                         back -- nor will you be turned 
                         aside... And when --

               One youth has flicked his cigarette -- hard. It lands at 
               Gandhi's feet. He pauses, looking at the youth.

                                     GANDHI
                         ...and when you do that it calls 
                         upon something in human nature -- 
                         something that makes his hate for 
                         you diminish and his respect increase. 
                         I think Christ grasped that and I -- 
                         I have seen it work.

               He starts forward again, he is almost on the youths -- clearly 
               frightened, but...

                                     GANDHI
                         Good morning.

                                     FIRST YOUTH
                         Get off the pavement, you bloody --

               And he reaches forth to haul Gandhi from the pavement, but --

                                     A WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Colin! Colin! What are you doing?

               A woman is leaning out of an upstairs window, looking down 
               at the fracas disconcertedly. It is the first youth's mother 
               and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility 
               considerably.

                                     FIRST YOUTH
                         Nuthing... nuthing. We were just 
                         cleaning up the neighborhood a little.

               A snickering response from the other youths -- but they are 
               embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of Colin's mother's 
               attitude. There's no note of apology in her cold stare at 
               Gandhi, but she clearly believes her son should not be doing 
               what he is doing.

                                     COLIN'S MOTHER
                         You're already late for work. I 
                         thought you'd gone ten minutes ago.

               The moment of crisis has passed. Nothing will happen while 
               she is there.

               Gandhi steps back on the pavement, addressing the first youth.

                                     GANDHI
                         You'll find there's room for us both.

               And he steps around him, Charlie trailing, as the first youth 
               stares at them sullenly.

               As they stride on, Charlie glancing back --

                                     CHARLIE
                              (relieved)
                         That was lucky.

                                     GANDHI
                         I thought you were a man of God.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (wittily, but making 
                              his point)
                         I am. But I'm not so egotistical as 
                         to think He plans His day around my 
                         dilemmas.

               Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner.

               BUSY STREET - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - MORNING

               A busy street in the center of the town. Gandhi and Charlie 
               come around the corner into it.

                                     GANDHI
                         ...you could call it a "communal 
                         farm," I suppose. But we've all come 
                         to the same conclusion -- our Gita, 
                         the Muslim's Koran or your Bible -- 
                         it's always the simple things that 
                         catch your breath -- "Love thy 
                         neighbor as thyself" --
                              (He smiles, thinking 
                              back at the youths.)
                         not always practiced -- but it's 
                         something we Hindus could learn a 
                         lot from.

               He has paused before an office and a young girl (Sonja) has 
               come from it to speak to him about something of urgency, but 
               she hovers, not interrupting.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's the sort of thing you'll be 
                         seeking on this "farm"...

                                     GANDHI
                              (a smile)
                         Well, we shall try.

               And now he turns to Sonja. Behind her we see the small office 
               "M.K. Gandhi/Attorney." Several clients waits, most of them 
               conspicuously poor. Sonja's tone is loaded with foreboding.

                                     SONJA
                         They're going to change the pass 
                         laws.

               Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly.

               SMUTS'S OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY

               A strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document.

                                     SMUTS'S VOICE-OVER
                         It's taken time, but it needed to be 
                         done fairly. We didn't want to create 
                         an injustice simply because Mr. Gandhi 
                         was abusing our existing legislation.

               Beneath the signature we see the boldly printed 
               identification: Jan Christian Smuts.

                                     SECOND VOICE
                         Just one second, sir, please.

               Another angle. A cameraman records the moment with a flash 
               photo. General Smuts, whose presence is equal to his office, 
               addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes 
               the document.

                                     SMUTS
                         But on a short trip, I wouldn't spend 
                         too much time on the Indian question, 
                         Mr. Walker. It's a tiny factor in 
                         South African life.

               The reporter who stands opposite him is Walker, much, much 
               younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the 
               funeral.

                                     WALKER
                              (a helpless shrug)
                         It's news at the moment. I will 
                         certainly report on your mines and 
                         the economy -- but I would like to 
                         meet this Mr. Gandhi.

               Smuts has risen. He knows how to concede with grace.

                                     SMUTS
                         Of course. We Westerners have a 
                         weakness for these -- these 
                         spiritually inclined men of India. 
                         But as an old lawyer, let me warn 
                         you, Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man 
                         as you will ever meet, however 
                         "otherworldly" he may seem. But I'm 
                         sure you're enough of a reporter to 
                         see that.

               The gaze is firm, strong, cynical...

               TENT - THE FARM - EXTERIOR - DAY

               The sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot. This is where 
               the magazine Indian Opinion is printed and we see stacks of 
               it lying around. A short Westerner (Albert West) is running 
               the simple printing press which is powered by a crude 
               generator. A small staff helping him. A Sikh, a Muslim, a 
               couple of Hindus, two young boys.

               Gandhi and Walker are approaching the tent from the river, 
               Gandhi discoursing earnestly.

                                     GANDHI
                         ...so it's not "spiritualism" or 
                         "nationalism" -- we're not against 
                         anything but the idea that people 
                         can't live together.

               They've reached the entrance to the tent, and he gestures 
               in.

                                     GANDHI
                         You see -- Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, 
                         Jews -- even Christians.

               This last remark has been directed toward Charlie Andrews, 
               who sits near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old 
               typewriter. He waves, and Gandhi shouts out to them all over 
               the putt-putt of the generator:

                                     GANDHI
                         Mr. Walker! Of The New York Times!

               They nod. One of the Hindus bows with his hands clasped 
               together. Gandhi hands Walker a copy of Indian Opinion and 
               they start across the relatively barren field toward some 
               other tents, Walker glancing at the paper. Gandhi watches 
               him, grinning.

                                     GANDHI
                         Without a paper -- a journal of some 
                         kind -- you cannot unite a community.
                              (A teasing smile.)
                         You belong to a very important 
                         profession.

                                     WALKER
                         Hm. And what should an "important 
                         professional" write about your 
                         response to General Smuts's new 
                         legislation?

                                     GANDHI
                         I don't know... I'm still searching 
                         for a "response."

                                     WALKER
                              (a leading question)
                         You will respect the law.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a beat)
                         There are unjust laws -- as there 
                         are unjust men.

               This carries a weight and apprehension that none of the rest 
               of the conversation has. Walker measures Gandhi with a little 
               surprise.

                                     WALKER
                         You're a very small minority to take 
                         on the Government -- and the Empire.

               Gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact.

                                     GANDHI
                         If you are a minority of one, the 
                         truth is the truth.

               Reluctant as it is, it too carries commitment and Walker 
               senses it. But they have come by a site where a building is 
               being erected, and a European (Kallenbach) is perched above 
               a doorway on the half-completed structure, getting a level. 
               Some Indians are working below him. Gandhi turns to him, 
               light-hearted again.

                                     GANDHI
                         This is Mr. Kallenbach. He is our 
                         chief carpenter -- and also our chief 
                         benefactor. He has made this 
                         experiment possible.

               Walker waves his notebook at him and Kallenbach lifts his 
               level in greeting. On his bronzed chest there is a Star of 
               David. Walker looks around, grinning, shaking his head. We 
               see two women in saris trying to quell some squabbling 
               children in the background.

                                     WALKER
                         Well, it's quite a place, your 
                         "ashram" -- is that right?

                                     GANDHI
                         That's right. The word only means 
                         "community." But it could stand for 
                         "village"... or the world.

               Walker looks at him appraisingly.

                                     WALKER
                         You're an ambitious man.

                                     GANDHI
                              (uncertainly)
                         I hope not.

               A moment of embarrassed doubt, then he starts toward a half-
               finished building -- wooden sides, door, but canvas still 
               covering the roof. It has an awning spread before it. Walker's 
               carriage is tethered nearby, a Black driver standing in the 
               sun, waiting. In the background we see two women cleaning a 
               latrine. Walker glances at the latrine.

                                     WALKER
                         They tell me you also take your turn 
                         at peeling potatoes and cleaning the 
                         "outhouse" -- is that part of the 
                         experiment?

               As we have approached we see a table set for tea under the 
               awning. There are two places. Having set the places, Ba is 
               walking along the side of the building, away from them. She 
               glances at Gandhi tautly and deliberately avoids speaking or 
               acknowledging him.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a little surprised, 
                              a little annoyed)
                         Ba -- we will need another place set 
                         for Mr. Walker's driver.

               Ba looks at him coldly.

                                     BA
                         I will tell Sora.

               She turns back and walks into the building by the rear 
               entrance. Gandhi is disconcerted by her attitude, but he 
               tries to answer Walker.

                                     GANDHI
                         It's one way to learn that each man's 
                         labor is as important as another's. 
                         In fact when you're doing it, 
                         "cleaning the outhouse" seems far 
                         more important than the law.

               A grin -- but forced. When a girl (Sora) comes from the 
               building bringing another cup and place setting, Gandhi calls 
               to the driver.

                                     GANDHI
                         Please come and join us -- you'll 
                         need something before your journey 
                         back.
                              (He nods to Walker.)
                         Excuse me a moment.

               And he goes into the building, determined to find the source 
               of Ba's aloofness.

               GANDHI'S HUT - INTERIOR - DAY

               Ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance to 
               the building. She does not look up at Gandhi, but she is 
               aware of his presence. He crosses and stands in front of her 
               with all the irritation of a husband. It is hushed, aware 
               that Walker might overhear them, but bristling with suppressed 
               anger.

                                     GANDHI
                         What is it?

               Now Ba looks at him hostilely.

                                     BA
                         Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must 
                         rake and cover the latrine.

                                     GANDHI
                         Everyone takes his turn.

                                     BA
                         It is the work of untouchables.

                                     GANDHI
                         In this place there are no 
                         untouchables -- and no work is beneath 
                         any of us!

                                     BA
                              (she looks up at him)
                         I am your wife.

                                     GANDHI
                         All the more reason.

               He holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his.

                                     BA
                              (finally, scornfully)
                         As you command.

               As she starts to rise he grabs her arm, but she pulls free.

                                     BA
                         The others may follow you -- but you 
                         forget, I knew you when you were a 
                         boy!

               She says it derisively and it stings, but Gandhi is aware of 
               Walker and he fights to hold his temper.

                                     GANDHI
                         It's not me. It's the principle. And 
                         you will do it with joy or not do it 
                         at all!

               Ba settles back defiantly.

                                     BA
                         Not at all then...

               For a moment Gandhi stares at her, and she back at him, 
               resentfully. He suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm, 
               pulling her roughly to her feet.

                                     GANDHI
                         All right, go! You don't belong here! 
                         Go! Leave the ashram! Get out 
                         altogether! We don't want you!

               It is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the rear 
               door, opening it to push her out as she struggles against 
               him.

                                     BA
                         Stop it! Stop it! What are you doing!?

               She lurches free of his grip, glaring at him angrily. For a 
               moment they both stare at each other, shattered by their 
               violence.

                                     BA
                              (bitterly)
                         Have you no shame? I'm your wife...
                              (Like lead)
                         Where do you expect me to go?

               Gandhi stares at her breathlessly, his temper subsiding into 
               a dazed remorse. He sinks numbly to a stool, sitting, holding 
               his head in his hands. Ba studies him for a moment -- and 
               she sighs, her temper and breathing subsiding too. She moves 
               and kneels before him.

                                     GANDHI
                         What is the matter with me...?

               A moment, then she soothes the top of his head -- like the 
               mother-wife she is.

                                     BA
                              (a beat)
                         You are human -- only human.

               Gandhi looks up at her, blankly, abjectly.

                                     BA
                         And it is even harder for those of 
                         us who do not even want to be as 
                         good as you do.

               And Gandhi grins weakly. Ba catches it and sends it back, 
               warmer, less complicated by doubts. Gandhi sighs, putting 
               his arms around her and she leans into him so that their 
               heads are touching.

                                     GANDHI
                         I apologize...

               Ba mutters "Hm" and holds him a little firmer. A moment.

                                     GANDHI
                         I must go back to that reporter.

               Ba nods.

                                     BA
                         ...And I must rake and cover the 
                         latrine.

               Gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her. She looks 
               at him evenly -- no smile, but the warmth still in her eyes.

               IMPERIAL THEATER - INTERIOR - NIGHT

               The theater is packed. The front rows near the stage are 
               held by rich Muslim merchants, the back of the stalls with 
               small traders, peddlers, artisans -- Muslim, Hindu, Parsee, 
               Sikh. The gallery is bulging with indentured laborers -- 
               largely Hindu. The mood is restless, belligerent.

               On the stage. Gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand 
               for silence. Seated on the stage are Khan, Singh, three more 
               leaders of the Indian community. Charlie Andrews and Herman 
               Kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs. Gandhi 
               looks around the audience and we see the packed house from 
               his point of view, ending with two plainclothes European 
               policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row. 
               A uniformed policeman stands near them.

                                     GANDHI
                              (to the house)
                         I want to welcome you all!

               A buzz, then applause -- loud and defiant. When is subsides 
               Gandhi looks down at the plainclothes policemen, fixing his 
               gaze on them.

                                     GANDHI
                         Every one of you.
                              (Then, still at them)
                         We -- have -- no -- secrets.

               And again the audience bursts into applause. The policemen 
               just sit like stone -- confident, sure, immune to rhetoric.

                                     GANDHI
                         Let us begin by being clear about 
                         General Smuts's new law. All Indians 
                         must now be fingerprinted -- like 
                         criminals. Men and women.
                              (A rising, angry 
                              response; Gandhi 
                              just waits.)
                         No marriage other than a Christian 
                         marriage is considered valid. Under 
                         this Act our wives and mothers are 
                         whores... And every man here a 
                         bastard.

               In the gallery a rhythmic pounding signals the anger and 
               protest and is taken up around the hall. The police stare 
               imperturbably. Khan leans towards Singh, nodding to Gandhi.

                                     KHAN
                         He's become quite good at this.

               Singh smiles at the understatement. Gandhi holds up his hand, 
               silencing the hall.

                                     GANDHI
                         And a policeman passing an Indian 
                         dwelling -- I will not call them 
                         homes -- may enter and demand the 
                         card or any Indian woman whose 
                         dwelling it is.

                                     A VOICE
                         God damn them!

               Gandhi just waits.

                                     GANDHI
                         Understand! He does not have to stand 
                         at the door -- he may enter.

               Now a violent response -- a large, powerful merchant rises 
               in the third row.

                                     MERCHANT
                         I swear to Allah I will kill the man 
                         who offers that insult to my home 
                         and my wife!
                              (A guttural cheer; he 
                              glares at the police.)
                         And let them hang me!

               Another cheer. When it subsides, Tyeb Mohammed rises near 
               the back, where he is seated with a number of other young 
               men.

                                     TYEB MOHAMMED
                         I say talk means nothing. Kill a few 
                         officials before they disgrace one 
                         Indian woman -- then they might think 
                         twice about such laws!

               The police half rise to look back at him, but there is a 
               smattering of applause and several stand to look back.

                                     TYEB MOHAMMED'S FRIEND
                         In that cause, I would be willing to 
                         die!

               And now there is general applause. Gandhi waits, then

                                     GANDHI
                         I praise such courage. I need such 
                         courage -- because in this cause, I 
                         too am prepared to die...
                              (A response; he looks 
                              at Tyeb Mohammed)
                         But, my friend, there is no cause 
                         for which I am prepared to kill.

               He looks at the audience. This is the more sober Gandhi they 
               have come to know.

                                     GANDHI
                         I have asked you here tonight because 
                         despite all their troops and police, 
                         I think there is a way to defeat 
                         this law. Whatever they do to us we 
                         will attack no one, kill no one... 
                         But we will not
                              (the climatic point)
                         give our fingerprints -- not one of 
                         us.

               He looks down at the police, making the point stick. There 
               is a tentative reaction from the audience, but uncertain.

                                     GANDHI
                         They will imprison us, they will 
                         fine us. They will seize our 
                         possessions. But they cannot take 
                         away our self-respect if we do not 
                         give it to them.

                                     VOICE FROM THE GALLERY
                         Have you been to prison? They'll 
                         beat us and torture us! I say --

                                     GANDHI
                         I am asking you to fight -- !
                              (It catches the 
                              audience a little, 
                              holds them.)
                         To fight against their anger -- not 
                         to provoke it!

               He has their attention now.

                                     GANDHI
                         We will not strike a blow -- but we 
                         will receive them. And through our 
                         pain we will make them see their 
                         injustice
                              (quickly)
                         and it will hurt, as all fighting 
                         hurts!
                              (Utter silence.)
                         ...But we cannot lose. We cannot.
                              (He looks down at the 
                              police.)
                         Because they may torture my body, 
                         may break my bones, even kill me...
                              (Up to the house)
                         They will then have my dead body -- 
                         not my obedience.

               And now he gets the response he has wanted. Firm, mature, 
               determined. Gandhi holds up his hand.

                                     GANDHI
                         We are Hindu and Muslim -- children 
                         of God, each of us. Let us take a 
                         solemn oath in His name that -- come 
                         what may -- we will not submit to 
                         this law.

               He looks at the audience. A second, then a merchant stands, 
               signifying his pledge. And then another. Then Tyeb Mohammed 
               and the youths about him. Then all over the theater they 
               begin to stand and on the stage until everyone is standing. 
               It is all done is silence. Gandhi looks at the full theater -- 
               all standing. He takes a step forward.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a coarse singing)
                         God save our gracious King... Long 
                         live our
                              (the audience takes 
                              it up)
                         ...noble King.
                              (And their voices 
                              fill the auditorium)
                         God save the King!!

               A prison door slams: we are close on one face, another slam, 
               another face, and again and again in the rhythm of marching 
               feet...

               MINE AREA - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed are leading a large procession 
               of Indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining complex -- 
               sheds, elevator platforms, pulleys -- toward a distant city.

               We see crude, handworked banners: "We are Citizens of the 
               Empire," "Justice for All," "One King -- One Law"...

               Tyeb Mohammed suddenly touches Gandhi's arm and nods ahead.

               Their point of view. A canvas-topped open touring car (circa 
               1910) pulls out from a turning between two factory buildings 
               and comes towards them.

               Resume Gandhi. There is a little hesitation in the ranks as 
               the car approaches. In it we can see two uniformed policemen 
               and a civilian.

               The car swings across the center of the road and stops right 
               in front of Gandhi.

                                     CIVILIAN
                         These men are contracted laborers. 
                         They belong in the mines.

                                     GANDHI
                         You have put their comrades in jail. 
                         When you free them they will go back 
                         to work.

               The civilian smiles slowly. He looks from Gandhi to the 
               miners.

                                     CIVILIAN
                         I've warned you.

                                     GANDHI
                         We have warned each other.

               The civilian looks at him sharply, then smiles derisively, 
               signaling the car off. As it pulls away, Tyeb Mohammed and 
               Singh come up to Gandhi, both made wary by the man's evident 
               satisfaction with what has transpired.

                                     SINGH
                         I don't think that is very good.

               Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly, then turns 
               and signals the miners on. They start forward.

               Their point of view. The car rides on past the factory 
               building out of which it turned, and suddenly mounted police 
               come swinging out from the buildings and face the procession.

               Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed as they 
               move forward, fear suddenly making their pace more labored.

               Tracking back before the mounted police.

                                     SERGEANT
                         At the canter -- for-ward!

               They come on fast, batons at the ready. Gandhi screws up his 
               courage, marching on. Tyeb Mohammed sets his jaw in defiance. 
               Singh forces himself along at Gandhi's side. The mounted 
               police riding on, batons at the ready.

               Featuring an Indian miner. He is in the front rank of the 
               procession, watching the horses approach. He has a blunt 
               farmer's face.

                                     MINER
                              (half to Gandhi)
                         We should lie down -- the horses 
                         won't tramp on us.
                              (Then shouting out)
                         Down! Down! Everyone lie down!

               He starts to go down, and others around him, convinced by 
               the authority of his voice.

               The sense of the idea seizes Gandhi, and as the sound of the 
               galloping horses nears, he turns and shouts too.

                                     GANDHI
                         Lie down! Lie down!

               And the miners begin to go down, some face up, shielding 
               their faces with their hands, some burying their faces in 
               the earth and covering their heads with their hands.

               Close fast traveling, the sergeant's point of view. We arrive 
               at the prone miners.

               Close on Gandhi, his arms crossed in front of his face, 
               staring up, frightened, but determined to bear it.

               Wide angle. The horses cannot bring themselves to gallop 
               over the human carpet; they rear, plunge, swerve.

               Close shot -- miner who shouted "down." He is peering through 
               his crossed hands, a tight smile of satisfaction at knowledge 
               confirmed. He turns to see:

               The sergeant thrown off his horse. He lands heavily, scrambles 
               up, furious, darts after it. Mounting, he is enraged to hear 
               laughter.

               Close shot. Singh and the miner who shouted "Down" kneeling, 
               grinning at the chaos.

                                     MINER
                         The horses have more mercy than the 
                         men.

               Singh smiles, but suddenly looks up fearfully. The sergeant 
               looms over them.

                                     SERGEANT
                         You're right!

               And without taking his booted foot from the stirrup he swings 
               it into the miner's face. The man goes down, bleeding.

               An angry roar from the miners. Several stand and shake their 
               fists. "Bastard!," "God damn you, Englishman!," "Jackal!" 
               The wounded miner himself starts to stagger up.

               The sergeant sweeps them, his eyes glittering -- this he can 
               deal with. But --

                                     GANDHI
                         Lie down! Lie down!

               It is a command, and angry in its own way, but it carries 
               all the weight of his influence on them. They begin to go 
               down again and the sergeant wheels his horse and rides at 
               Gandhi.

               With deliberate, almost fatalistic pace, Gandhi goes first 
               to his knees and then sprawls down flat, his hands over the 
               top of his head, awaiting the blow of the horse's hoof.

               Close shot, the horse's head, its eyes rolling as it swerves 
               again.

               Close shot, the sergeant controlling it, cursing, but unable 
               to make it plunge down on the man.

               Full shot, the sergeant wheeling his horse, angrily -- 
               surveying the whole of the procession as they lie sprawled 
               on the ground, his mounted police circling in front of them, 
               not knowing what to do.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Follow me!

               He turns his horse angrily and gallops back toward the 
               factories.

               Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed are looking off at the 
               retreating horses. The car with the civilian has returned in 
               the distance.

               Gandhi looks at the miner who first shouted "Down" -- a smile, 
               a nod of recognition and thanks. The miner grins, rubbing at 
               the blood on his face, shrugging off Gandhi's implied praise.

               Featuring the police. The sergeant wheels by the car with 
               the civilian; his police turn their horses, lining up across 
               the road again.

               Their point of view. Gandhi and the miners coming on once 
               more, chanting forcefully. "One King! One Law! One King! One 
               Law!"

                                     SERGEANT
                         What the hell are we supposed to do 
                         now?

                                     CIVILIAN
                              (watching the 
                              procession narrowly)
                         Let them march... In our own sweet 
                         time, in our own sweet way -- we'll 
                         get them.

               SMALL CHURCH - SOUTH AFRICA - INTERIOR - DAY

               We are close on Charlie Andrews.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Some of you may be rejoicing that 
                         Mr. Gandhi has at last been put into 
                         prison.

               The congregation is listening to him stiffly, 
               unsympathetically, and there is more than one murmur of assent 
               at his words. The clergyman who has given Charlie the use of 
               his pulpit sits beneath it, embarrassed, but sticking 
               resolutely to his decision to give Charlie a hearing.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But I would ask you -- assembled 
                         here in this house of God -- to 
                         recognize that we are witnessing 
                         something new, something so 
                         unexpected, so unusual that it is 
                         not surprising the Government is at 
                         a loss. What Mr. Gandhi has forced 
                         us to do is ask questions about 
                         ourselves.

               A few men in the congregation rise and pointedly escort their 
               families from the church. Charlie struggles on.

                                     CHARLIE
                         As Christians, those are difficult 
                         questions to answer. How do we treat 
                         men who defy an unjust law -- men 
                         who will not fight, but will not 
                         comply?

               More of the congregation rise and march from the church... 
               though a few pointedly do not.

               PRISON YARD - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Small, packed. Gandhi is threading his way in a line for 
               soup. But it is a line that winds through masses of prisoners, 
               some with bowls, eating, some not yet in the line.

               As Gandhi near the two stone blocks that hold the large 
               barrels of soup, he sees that Khan is serving from one of 
               them. He too wears a prison uniform and there is a bandage 
               on his head. When he turns and reacts to the sight of Gandhi --

                                     GANDHI
                         They're sparing no one, I see.

                                     KHAN
                         No. You were the surprise. It's been 
                         all over the prison. We thought they'd 
                         be too afraid of the English press.

                                     GANDHI
                         So did I.

               He takes his soup from Khan.

                                     KHAN
                              (acidly)
                         Don't worry about the meat -- it's 
                         Hindu
                              (referring to the 
                              soup)
                         -- there's not a trace.

               Gandhi smiles, but they turn as the gate opens and a paddy 
               wagon is backed into the press of prisoners. Khan shakes his 
               head.

                                     KHAN
                         I don't know who they've left out 
                         there to do the work. There can't be 
                         one mine left open. Have they touched 
                         the women?

                                     GANDHI
                         My wife publicly defied the law. 
                         They've arrested her and four others.

                                     KHAN
                              (angrily)
                         The fools!
                              (He spills some soup.)
                         Sorry...

                                     GANDHI
                         It's split the Government.

                                     KHAN
                         Well, that's one victory.

               Gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages, 
               the defiant, determined faces.

                                     GANDHI
                         If we hold firm, it won't be the 
                         last.

                                     KHAN
                         Don't worry -- I've never seen men 
                         so determined. You've given them a 
                         way to fight... And I don't think --

               He is distracted by a phalanx of guards (an officer and four 
               men) pushing their way through the prisoners.

                                     PRISON OFFICER
                         Gandhi! I want Gandhi! Which sammy 
                         is it?

               The prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their 
               glances reveal who Gandhi is. The prison officer's eyes fall 
               on him.

               CITY STREET - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A side street, but active. Gandhi -- now manacled -- is being 
               marched down the pavement before two guards. The prison 
               officer strides in front of them. People in the street stop 
               and turn, staring. That part of Gandhi that is still the 
               dandy is discomfited, but there is a growing part of him 
               that defies appearances.

               Featuring a doorway. It is the side door of a large imposing 
               building. The prison officer leads his little procession 
               toward it. He knocks and the door opens. The tall civil 
               servant has been waiting for them. The prison officer reaches 
               forward and undoes Gandhi's manacles.

               GOVERNMENT BUILDING - INTERIOR - DAY

               The tall civil servant, moving with aloof distaste for his 
               assignment, walks ahead of Gandhi, who in turn is followed 
               by one of the prison guards, toward a grand staircase that 
               is at right angles to them (i.e. facing the front of the 
               building). People working in offices pause to stare at Gandhi 
               as he moves along, more uncomfortably aware of his prison 
               garb than ever.

               The grand staircase. The tall civil servant turns and starts 
               up the staircase. Gandhi is even more exposed to everyone's 
               surveillance on the wide, white expanse of the stairway. He 
               hesitates, looking around in discomfort, then follows the 
               tall civil servant on toward the large, white doors at the 
               top of the staircase.

               SMUTS'S ANTEROOM - INTERIOR - DAY

               The tall white doors open, the tall civil servant indicates 
               that Gandhi enter. Gandhi passes two male secretaries, and 
               the tall civil servant scoots decorously around him to knock 
               once on the inner doors. Then he pushes them open and gestures 
               Gandhi in.

               SMUTS'S OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY

               We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now 
               we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts 
               makes as he stands behind the grand desk.

                                     SMUTS
                         Ah, Mr. Gandhi. I thought we might 
                         have a little talk.

               He nods to the tall civil servant, who bows and closes the 
               door. Smuts crosses the room toward a small cabinet.

                                     SMUTS
                         Will you have a glass of sherry?

                                     GANDHI
                         Thank you. No.

               Smuts looks at Gandhi, a little surprised at the frigid tone 
               of that refusal.

                                     SMUTS
                         Perhaps some tea?

                                     GANDHI
                              (a shake of the head)
                         I dined at the prison.

                                     SMUTS
                         Ahh.

               He appraises Gandhi, measuring the irony of his words, his 
               determination. Then with a little sigh at the lost opportunity 
               he replaces the stopper on the sherry, turns and gestures 
               Gandhi on into the room.

                                     SMUTS
                         Please -- please do come and sit 
                         down. It's prison I wanted to talk 
                         to you about.

               He has indicated a chair near his desk, but as Gandhi goes 
               forward he pauses by a spread of papers from England on a 
               long table near the middle of the room. We see one headline 
               in close shot: "Thousands Imprisoned in South Africa/Mines 
               Close. Crops Unharvested," a subhead, "Gandhi Leads Non-
               Violent Campaign." He looks at Smuts. Smuts smiles, a passing 
               nod at the papers.

                                     SMUTS
                         Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided 
                         to ask the House to repeal the Act 
                         that you have taken such "exception" 
                         to.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a beat)
                         Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm 
                         sure it will be done.

               Smuts smiles.

                                     SMUTS
                         Hm. Of course it is not quite that 
                         simple.

                                     GANDHI
                         Somehow I expected not.

               A wry smile, and he sits on the edge of the chair Smuts has 
               directed him to. Smuts measures him again, not absolutely 
               certain how to deal with him. A pause, and he affects to 
               take Gandhi's irony at face value.

                                     SMUTS
                         I'm glad to hear you say that... 
                         very glad. You see if we repeal the 
                         Act under pressure
                              (a nod at the papers 
                              again)
                         under this kind of pressure it will 
                         create a great deal of resentment. 
                         Can you understand that?

                                     GANDHI
                         Very well.

               And Gandhi does understand it -- as a guiding principle. 
               Never humiliate your enemy. And his tone conveys it.

                                     SMUTS
                              (a bit surprised)
                         Good. Good.
                              (The bland politician: 
                              the compromise.)
                         I have thought of calling for a Royal 
                         Commission to "investigate" the new 
                         legislation.
                              (He gestures, implying 
                              they'll do what 
                              they're told.)
                         I think I could guarantee they would 
                         recommend the Act be repealed.

                                     GANDHI
                              (waiting for the catch)
                         I congratulate them.

               Smuts does a slight double take, a smile, then the "tough" 
               politician.

                                     SMUTS
                         But they might also recommend that 
                         future Indian immigration be severely 
                         restricted -- even stopped.

               He measures Gandhi challengingly, obviously expecting some 
               contest. Gandhi mulls it, then

                                     GANDHI
                         Immigration was not an issue on which 
                         we fought. It would be wrong of us 
                         to make it one now that we -- we are 
                         in a position of advantage.

               Smuts stares at him... a moment, then

                                     SMUTS
                         You're an extraordinary man.

                                     GANDHI
                              (his grin; he brushes 
                              at his prison garb)
                         I assure you I feel a very ordinary 
                         man at this moment.

               And now Smuts smiles with him. He bends suddenly and signs a 
               group of documents.

                                     SMUTS
                         I'm ordering the release of all 
                         prisoners within the next twenty-
                         four hours. You yourself are free 
                         from this moment.

               Gandhi stands, a little uncertain about the sudden change in 
               his status. Smuts signs the last document, then sees Gandhi's 
               doubt -- and misreads it.

                                     SMUTS
                         Assuming we are in agreement?

                                     GANDHI
                         Yes -- yes. It's just that... in 
                         these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to 
                         go by taxi.

                                     SMUTS
                              (confused by his 
                              hesitation)
                         All right. Fine.

                                     GANDHI
                         I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.

                                     SMUTS
                         Oh!
                              (He quickly feels in 
                              his waistcoat pockets -- 
                              and realizes he has 
                              no money!)
                         Neither have I.
                              (He reaches forth and 
                              touches a buzzer.)
                         I'm awfully sorry.

               The tall civil servant (Daniels) enters.

                                     SMUTS
                         Daniels, would you lend Mr. Gandhi a 
                         shilling for a taxi?

               Daniel stares.

                                     DANIELS
                         I beg your pardon, sir?

                                     SMUTS
                              (a second thought)
                         How far will you be going, Mr. Gandhi?

                                     GANDHI
                              (a mischievous smile)
                         Well -- now that this is settled -- 
                         I had thought seriously of going 
                         back to India
                              (he faces the startled 
                              Daniel)
                         but a shilling will do splendidly 
                         for the moment.

               Still a little confused, Daniels reaches in his pocket and 
               produces a shilling. He hands it to Gandhi.

                                     GANDHI
                         Thank you.
                              (To Smuts)
                         Thank you both for a very enlightening 
                         experience.

               He bows slightly and starts out the door. Daniels immediately 
               starts to accompany him, but Gandhi stops. A beat.

                                     GANDHI
                              (ice)
                         I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels, but I will 
                         find my own way out.

               And his own steel shows in the oblique reference to the 
               ignominy of his way in. Daniel bows, and he and Smuts just 
               stare as the uniformed "prisoner" goes out through the grand 
               doors, past the stunned men in the office to the outer doors 
               and on to the grand staircase. The prison guard appears in 
               the doorway, looking off in confusion at Gandhi, then back 
               at the office for guidance. Daniels simply shakes his head 
               "Let him be."

               Finally, when Gandhi has disappeared down the stairs, Daniels 
               turns to Smuts.

                                     SMUTS
                              (a shake of the head)
                         He's either a great man or a colossal 
                         fraud... Either way, I shall be glad 
                         to see the last of him.

               THE PIER AT BOMBAY - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Ship's siren, military band... a jubilant crowd on the pier, 
               passengers waving to the receiving crowd. A group of First 
               Class passengers, ninety percent English, look down from the 
               upper deck.

               From their point of view. We see the main section of the 
               pier, a crowd of mostly European civilians on one side. A 
               mass of military on the other: European officers, topees and 
               swagger sticks, Indian cavalry, Gurkha infantry, Sikh lanoers -- 
               turbans, rifles, bugles, an Indian military band -- a showy 
               awe-inspiring display.

               Featuring two Englishmen. First Class passengers, white suits, 
               Oxbridge accents; one quite young, the other a bit older, 
               both civil servants coming to "administer" India.

                                     YOUNG ENGLISHMAN
                         By God, he loves it...

               Their point of view. A British general is coming down the 
               gangplank accompanied by his ADC. The officer commanding and 
               the Guard of Honor await him.

                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN
                         I'm sure he hates it.

               The young Englishman glances at him quizzically. The General 
               has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the 
               accompaniment of the military band.

                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN
                         Generals' reputations are being made 
                         in France today, fighting on the 
                         Western Front. Not as Military 
                         Governors in India.

               He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening 
               to their conversation. He glances at him and the well-dressed 
               Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little. The second 
               Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down 
               again.

                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN
                         What the devil's going on back there?

               He is looking aft. His point of view.

               Another far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft 
               section of the ship. Third Class passengers are disembarking 
               here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest 
               of the pier. A large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly 
               to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see 
               that person.

               The young Englishman glances back at the well-dressed Indian 
               to make sure of his distance, then speaks quietly.

                                     YOUNG ENGLISHMAN
                         It must be that Indian that made all 
                         that fuss back in Africa. My cabin 
                         boy told me he was on board.

                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN
                         Why haven't we seen him?
                              (Finding the name)
                         Gandhi?

                                     YOUNG ENGLISHMAN
                         Yes. That's it. He was traveling 
                         Third Class. There he is.

               Their point of view.

               There has been a little hiatus in those disembarking but now 
               Gandhi has appeared, coming down the gangplank with Ba and 
               the children (grown-up sons now), and three or four people 
               behind them, including the tall figure of Charlie Andrews. 
               But Gandhi is wearing an Indian tunic and sandals and he has 
               shaved his hair except for a central section on the top.

                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN'S VOICE-OVER
                         God -- he's dressed like a coolie! I 
                         thought he was a lawyer.

               The young Englishman glances back cautiously toward the well-
               dressed Indian again, then

                                     YOUNG ENGLISHMAN
                         After he came out of jail he refused 
                         to wear European clothes.

               THE PIER - THIRD CLASS AREA - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the 
               questions of an Indian journalist.

                                     GANDHI
                         No, no, I haven't "refused"... I -- 
                         I simply wanted to dress the way my 
                         comrades in prison dressed.

               He speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had 
               lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception. 
               An English journalist catches him as he turns.

                                     ENGLISH JOURNALIST
                         Will you support the war effort, Mr. 
                         Gandhi?

               An exuberant woman puts a garland over his shoulders.

                                     GANDHI
                         I -- I have demanded rights as a 
                         British citizen, it is therefore my 
                         duty to help in the defense of the 
                         British Empire.

               He smiles uncertainly again. As he turns he is face to face 
               with an American reporter.

                                     AMERICAN REPORTER
                         What are you going to do now that 
                         you're back in India?

                                     GANDHI
                         I don't know... I don't know...

               An Indian reporter has cornered Ba behind him.

                                     SECOND INDIAN REPORTER
                         As an Indian woman how could you 
                         accept the indignity of prison?

               Gandhi half-twists to hear Ba's answer, but his arm is taken 
               by a young Indian (Nehru) in elegant European clothes. Another 
               garland is thrown over his shoulders.

                                     NEHRU
                         Please, Mr. Gandhi.

               Featuring Ba. Offhand, her eyes on Gandhi ahead.

                                     BA
                         My dignity comes from following my 
                         husband.

               She joins her hands, acknowledging a garland placed around 
               her shoulders, and pushes on after Gandhi. Charlie helps to 
               guide her.

               Featuring Gandhi. The young Nehru, somewhat amused by all 
               the excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a little 
               flower-covered platform. We see a banner: THE CONGRESS PARTY 
               WELCOMES GANDHI.

                                     NEHRU
                              (he too speaks with 
                              an Oxbridge accent)
                         Just a few words -- then we'll get 
                         you to civilization.

               He grins. He has guided Gandhi to the first step of the 
               platform. Another garland is wrapped around Gandhi's 
               shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he mounts the platform. 
               There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we 
               hear the military band from across the way as the troops 
               prepare to march off. Gandhi looks around at the crowd. 
               Finally he speaks out.

                                     GANDHI
                         I -- I am glad to be home.
                              (A little round of 
                              applause.)
                         I -- I thank you for your greeting.

               He makes the pranam and starts for the steps. The crowd is a 
               little disappointed, but they manage a cheer and applause.

               Nehru is standing next to a heavy-set, well-dressed man 
               (Patel). They exchange a wry glance, "Not exactly a world-
               beater."

               A car door slams. The camera pulls back. Nehru has slammed 
               the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down. 
               He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's 
               knapsack. An Indian chauffeur rides in front. The crowd still 
               surges around and Gandhi is looking apprehensively back for 
               Ba.

                                     NEHRU
                         We'll follow with your wife -- don't 
                         worry, everything's arranged.

               He grins boyishly, in part to comfort, in part unable to 
               contain his amusement at Gandhi and his evident confusion.

               PATEL'S CAR - STREETS OF BOMBAY - EXTERIOR - DAY

               With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car pulls off. 
               He finally turns to Patel.

                                     GANDHI
                         Who is that young man?

                                     PATEL
                         That's young Nehru. He's got his 
                         father's intellect, his mother's 
                         looks and the devil's charm. If they 
                         don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! 
                         Wave! -- he may amount to something.

               There are crowds along the street, and Gandhi -- in surprise 
               that they are for him -- waves tentatively. Patel waves too 
               but he eyes Gandhi rather critically.

                                     PATEL
                         I must say when I first saw you as a 
                         bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I 
                         never thought I'd be greeting you as 
                         a national hero.

                                     GANDHI
                         I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

                                     PATEL
                         Oh, yes, you are. It's been two 
                         hundred years since an Indian has 
                         cocked a snoot at the British Empire 
                         and got away with it. And stop calling 
                         me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior 
                         clerk anymore.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a beat; still hesitant)
                         No.

               They have come to a main thoroughfare. A crowd still lines 
               the streets but it is thin and around and between we see 
               groups of desperate poor, parked on the pavement, staring 
               with blank curiosity at the passing car, but too listless 
               and too out of touch to move from their little squatters' 
               patches.

               Patel looks at Gandhi's clothes rather disapprovingly.

                                     PATEL
                         The new Military Governor of the 
                         North West Province was on that ship. 
                         Too bad you came back Third Class -- 
                         he might have been impressed by a 
                         successful barrister who had 
                         outmaneuvered General Smuts.

               Gandhi is staring at the street. From his point of view we 
               hold on a gaunt young, aged woman holding a baby wrapped in 
               rags as threadbare as her sari. Another hollow-faced child 
               leans against her.

                                     GANDHI
                              (leadenly)
                         Yes... I'm sure...

               PATEL'S GARDEN - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A splendid peacock, its tail fanned in brilliant display, 
               lords it on a velvet lawn. A woman in a sumptuous silk sari 
               is trying to feed it crumbs. Behind her, Gandhi's reception 
               is in full spate -- silver trays, tables covered in fine 
               linen, Indian servants, a swimming pool, a small fountain, 
               the grounds filled with Indian millionaires and dignitaries 
               gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from South 
               Africa.

               A beautiful and beautifully dressed woman (Mrs. Nehru) stands 
               next to her distinguished husband (Motilal Nehru).

                                     MRS. NEHRU
                              (wittily)
                         No, I leave practical matters to my 
                         husband and revolution to my son...

               She nods lightly toward Nehru.

               Featuring Nehru who is introducing Gandhi to two men, one 
               tall, slender, ascetic looking, but dressed impeccably 
               (Jinnah). The other with a haunting face -- beard, flowing 
               dark hair, the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical 
               (Prakash -- whom we recognize from the opening sequence in 
               Delhi at Gandhi's assassination).

                                     NEHRU
                         Mr. Jinnah, our joint host, member 
                         of Congress, and the leader of the 
                         Muslim League and Mr. Prakash, who I 
                         fear is awaiting trial for sedition 
                         and inducement to murder.

               Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah, now he looks a little startled 
               at Prakash. Prakash grins and makes the pranam to Gandhi.

                                     PRAKASH
                         I have not actually pulled a trigger, 
                         Mr. Gandhi, I have simply written 
                         that if an Englishman kills an Indian 
                         for disobeying his law, then it is 
                         an Indian's duty to kill an Englishman 
                         for enforcing his law in a land that 
                         is not his.

               Gandhi nods...

                                     GANDHI
                         It is a clever argument; I am not 
                         sure it will produce the end you 
                         desire.

               He meets Prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have 
               seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa.

                                     JINNAH
                              (testingly)
                         We hope you intend to join us in the 
                         struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a pause)
                         I --

               Charlie Andrews touches Gandhi's arm, excusing himself to 
               the others.

                                     CHARLIE
                         May I? Mohan -- I would like you to 
                         meet someone.

               Gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an Indian bishop 
               in full clerical robes. Behind him we see Patel regaling a 
               small group with some story of court or society.

               As Gandhi leaves, Jinnah, Nehru and Prakash watch him 
               clinically. Except for the servants, Gandhi is the only Indian 
               male not in European clothes.

                                     NEHRU
                         He told the press he would support 
                         the British in the war.

                                     PRAKASH
                              (acidly)
                         That's non-violence for you.

                                     JINNAH
                         Is he a fool?

               Nehru grins slowly, thoughtfully.

                                     NEHRU
                         I'm not certain... But I wouldn't be 
                         surprised.

               We get a shot of Ba in a gathering of Indian women. She stands 
               listening, seemingly tongue-tied in the sophisticated patter. 
               And we cut to Charlie introducing Gandhi to a man in obvious 
               ill health, but well dressed, looking like the professor, 
               philosopher and elder statesman he is (Gokhale).

                                     CHARLIE
                         I lied to you, Mohan, when I told 
                         you I decided to come to South Africa 
                         to meet you. Professor Gokhale sent 
                         me.

               Gokhale is pleased, Gandhi amused. He bows very respectfully.

                                     GOKHALE
                         We're trying to make a nation, Gandhi -- 
                         and the British keep trying to break 
                         us up into religions and 
                         principalities and "provinces." What 
                         you were writing in South Africa -- 
                         that's what we need here.

               He has offered his hand during this, and Gandhi has helped 
               him from the garden chair he has been seated on, handing him 
               the cane that is resting against it.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a smile)
                         I have much to learn about India. 
                         And I have to begin my practice again -- 
                         one needs money to run a journal.

               Another grin. Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking 
               at him intently, penetratingly.

                                     GOKHALE
                         Nonsense.
                              (He turns to Charlie)
                         Go on, Charlie. This is Indian talk -- 
                         we want none of you imperialists.

               It is brusque but affectionate; we know he regards Charlie 
               as Gandhi does... and Charlie does too.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (a mock threat)
                         All right -- I'll go and write my 
                         report to the Viceroy.

                                     GOKHALE
                         Go and find a pretty Hindu woman and 
                         convert her to Christianity -- that's 
                         as much mischief as you're allowed.

               He still hasn't smiled, but Gandhi and Charlie have.

               ANOTHER PART OF THE GARDEN

               This is private -- beautiful and still. Gandhi walks along 
               slowly, taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale.

                                     GOKHALE
                         Forget your practice. India has many 
                         men with too much wealth -- it is 
                         their privilege to nourish the efforts 
                         of the few who can raise India from 
                         servitude and apathy. I will see to 
                         it -- you begin your journal.

                                     GANDHI
                         I have little to say. India is an 
                         "alien" country to me.

               He grins self-deprecatingly but Gokhale persists.

                                     GOKHALE
                         Well, change that. Go and find India. 
                         Not what you see here, but the real 
                         India. You'll see what needs to be 
                         said. What we need to hear.

               He pauses and looks at Gandhi -- and for the first time he 
               smiles. When he speaks his voice is thick with feeling.

                                     GOKHALE
                         When I saw you in that tunic I knew... 
                         I knew I could die in peace.
                              (A dying man's command)
                         Make India proud of herself.

               His eyes are watery with emotion, but he stares at Gandhi 
               rigidly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TRAIN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

               Indian. Steam. A breed of its own.

               THIRD CLASS COACH - INTERIOR - NIGHT

               Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach. Ba sleeps on 
               the seat next to him, another member of the party next to 
               her. Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity 
               in the rocking coach. People are sleeping everywhere, some 
               half-erect on the benches, many on the floor among the bundles 
               and trunks and bedrolls and baskets. Some have children, 
               some are very old. One old man, sleepless like Gandhi, stares 
               back at him across the shadowed squalor of the coach; 
               somewhere unseen a crying baby is soothed by his mother.

               Gandhi looks at the bench across from him. Charlie Andrews, 
               his tall frame cramped in a tiny space between the window 
               looks at Gandhi dozily, a little smile of sufferance, then 
               he closes his eyes again, leaning his head against the rocking 
               window frame.

               NARROW STREET - A SMALL TOWN - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi is carried along in a ceremonial chair borne on the 
               shoulders of some trotting men. The chair is swathed in 
               flowers, and flowers are being showered on Gandhi by the 
               running children and the crowd lining the narrow street. Ba 
               and Charlie and two others are following in a flower-bedecked 
               ox-cart, lost in the mass of people that are swirling around 
               Gandhi.

               On a building top a British officer watches emotionlessly as 
               Gandhi and the crowd pass below him. On this building and 
               others we see some on his Indian soldiers watching with their 
               rifles beside them.

               INDIAN VILLAGES - EXTERIOR - DAY

               As from a train... but the shots are varied; some close of 
               farmers and water buffalo, and ragged children and women in 
               colorful saris carrying pots on their heads, and some distant 
               of villages as units, one and another and another.

               INTERCUT ALWAYS WITH:

               TRAIN - INTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi's face in the window, he and Ba standing, looking out 
               together, neither speaking. Gandhi writing in the cramped 
               chaos of the Third Class coaches. Gandhi sweeping part of 
               the carriage, making disgruntled passengers move as he tries 
               to bring some cleanliness to their surroundings.

               RIVER VISTA - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A broad alluvial plain, the river threading through it, purple 
               and gold in the rising sun. The camera races with the train 
               along the river's edge, the reflected sun glimmering on the 
               windows.

               RIVER BANK - EXTERIOR - DAY

               The sun is high and the train is stopped by the river. People 
               have come out of the coaches to cool their heads with the 
               touch of water, to stretch their legs.

               We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, 
               dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some 
               British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight 
               with fun.

               And, farther along, the parasols of one or two of the English 
               First Class passengers, a woman dousing her neck delicately 
               with perfume. A British officer, tunic unbuttoned, smoking a 
               long cigar as he walks along in a few inches of water, his 
               trousers rolled up, his shoes off.

               Across the river down from the Third Class coaches a small 
               group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing 
               clothes. Some carry infants on their backs. Some small 
               children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, 
               but they are all watching the passengers of the train.

               Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class 
               passengers. Ba cools her face with water. Charlie, his 
               trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a 
               skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white 
               head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes 
               have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river.

               And now we see the women closely from his point of view, the 
               camera panning slowly along them. Their bodies are skin and 
               bone. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the 
               distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on 
               another. The children are hollow-eyed and gaunt, staring 
               listlessly at the train. One boy, with a stump for an arm, 
               aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him.

               Gandhi stands erect, lost now in the revelation of their 
               poverty. His eyes hold on one woman at the river bank. Though 
               her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred 
               by a severe rash down her cheek and neck. The cloth she is 
               washing is a shredded piece of muslin. Her eyes have met 
               Gandhi's as he watches her.

               Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Then he slowly moves 
               his arm out into the water and, without taking his eyes from 
               her, releases the head cloth he has been rinsing. It floats 
               along on the water down toward the woman.

               She looks from Gandhi to it with sudden excitement, a sense 
               of incredulity. As the cloth nears her, she rises and moves 
               almost greedily out into the water to take it. Her hands 
               snatch at it quickly. Then she stands, looking at Gandhi. 
               The infant on her back shifts, its huge hollow eyes reacting 
               to the movement.

               Gandhi smiles slowly, tilting his head just slightly to her. 
               And now that she has possession of the cloth, her manner 
               calms again. And she looks back at him, and her lips almost 
               part with a tiny smile of thanks.

               Hold Gandhi, staring at her, fighting the pain in his eyes...

               TRAIN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

               Threading like a lighted necklace across the darkness of a 
               vast plain.

               TRAIN IN HILLS - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Climbing green hills -- a totally different terrain -- and 
               again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and 
               buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; 
               farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and 
               faster... until suddenly with a hoot of the whistle and the 
               screech of brakes it stops!

               TRAIN - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach. 
               Ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have 
               jumped down.

               Gandhi and Charlie jump down too. As they come clear they 
               can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has 
               been derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry are 
               coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them.

               Featuring the cavalry. They are British and their troop leader 
               is viciously angry.

                                     TROOP LEADER
                         Clear the way! Get out of the way!

               He is swinging his sword, not lethally, but threateningly at 
               the Indian passengers from the train. His British NCOs are 
               equally angry and deliberately ride close to the passengers, 
               forcing them back against the train.

               Gandhi and Charlie step back. And as the troop goes past we 
               see from their point of view a group of Indian bearers, 
               trotting in the middle of the horsemen, carrying two litters -- 
               covered, each hanging by straps from a long pole -- and each 
               bearing a badly wounded British soldier; one appears to be 
               dead.

               OUTSKIRTS OF VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY

               The shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground, a sense 
               of tension and foreboding. We hear the engine chugging slowly. 
               The camera lifts. Gandhi and Charlie stand at a window, 
               staring out grimly. Other passengers are looking off too. Ba 
               is seated, staring straight ahead, her face taut, deliberately 
               not seeing what the others are seeing.

               GALLOWS - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Their point of view: On a hill across from the railroad track 
               part of a prison wall is visible. In front of it a thick 
               pole is straddled across two others. From this crude gallows 
               two Indian men hang by the neck. One is in turban and dhoti, 
               the other in a tunic. The sound of the train stopping.

               VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Close shot. Incense rising in shot. The camera pulls back 
               and back. The incense is burning in a bowl sitting before 
               Gandhi on a make-shift platform set in the little valley 
               between the train line and the little hill where the Indian 
               men have been hanged. A small crowd sits in a crescent before 
               him, Ba and Charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind 
               him. When the camera comes to rest, the edge of the gallows 
               and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame. We 
               know we are looking from someone's point of view near the 
               prison wall.

               Finally, Gandhi lifts his head.

                                     GANDHI
                              (at first distant, as 
                              from the hill)
                         I ask you to pray for those who died.
                              (Closer)
                         For the English soldiers...
                              (a murmur)
                         who were doing what they thought was 
                         right.
                              (Closer)
                         And for the brave terrorists whose 
                         patriotism led them to do what was 
                         wrong.

               The murmur of resistance from the crowd is louder at this. 
               Gandhi shakes his head at the dissent.

                                     GANDHI
                         It is not my law, it is the law of 
                         creation. We reap what we sow. Out 
                         there in the fields -- and in our 
                         hearts. Violence sows hatred, and 
                         the will to revenge. In them. And in 
                         us.

               He looks up.

               HILLSIDE - HIS POINT OF VIEW

               The troop leader, on horseback, is on the hill beside the 
               gallows. The first view of Gandhi on the platform was his. 
               Some of his troops are lined up beside him. He stares down 
               at Gandhi coldly.

               PATEL'S SWIMMING POOL - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Patel lounges in the water on his back, supported by a large 
               air pillow. Nehru sits at the side of the pool in a swimming 
               suit, his feet dangling in the water. Jinnah sits under an 
               umbrella in an elegant white suit, being served tea by one 
               of three or four servants around. Patel spews a fountain of 
               water.

                                     PATEL
                         I agree with Jinnah. Now that the 
                         Americans are in, the war will end 
                         soon. The Germans are worn out as it 
                         is...
                              (he rolls over, facing 
                              Nehru)
                         and our first act should be to convene 
                         a Congress Party convention and demand 
                         independence.

               Nehru takes an iced drunk from a servant.

                                     JINNAH
                         And we must speak with one voice -- 
                         united.

               The others assent. Nehru shakes his head wistfully.

                                     PATEL
                              (it reminds him)
                         Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What 
                         the devil has happened to him anyway?

                                     NEHRU
                         He's "discovering" India.

                                     JINNAH
                              (cynically)
                         Which is a lot better than causing 
                         trouble where it matters. Invite him -- 
                         let him say his piece about South 
                         Africa -- and then let him slip into 
                         oblivion.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TRAIN - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A fireman heaps coal into an engine's boiler.

               The train passes camera to the Third Class section, which 
               seems besieged by humanity. People cling to the outside of 
               each door and many more are seated on the central wooden 
               planks on the roofs of the two coaches.

               THIRD CLASS COACH - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi and Charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, 
               hanging on through the door, and both enjoying it immensely. 
               Ba, inside the jammed coach, finds it very unfunny. She has 
               a grip on one of Gandhi's arms.

                                     BA
                              (quietly, private)
                         Please! You're being foolish!

                                     GANDHI
                         There's no room! And the air is 
                         lovely.

               She grimaces severely and tugs at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No violence, please.

                                     GANDHI
                         Let me hang on with two hands or I 
                         will fall.

               Featuring the roof. And Indian squats right on the edge of 
               the roof above Charlie. He is looking down, offering a hand.

                                     INDIAN
                              (over the sound of 
                              the engine)
                         Englishman Sahib!

               Charlie, who has been grinning, suddenly looks baffled, not 
               to say appalled.

                                     INDIAN
                         Come! Come! There is room!

               His hand still dangles in offering to the tall Charlie.

               Another angle. Two other Indians on the roof move to where 
               they can grip the first Indian's other arm, as counterforce 
               to the weight of Charlie.

                                     FIRST INDIAN
                              (to Charlie)
                         Place the foot on the window.

               Featuring Charlie. Hesitatingly, he grips the inside of the 
               window higher, and starts to swing one foot onto the window 
               ledge.

                                     GANDHI
                              (amused, but 
                              disconcerted)
                         What are you doing?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (grimly)
                         Going nearer to God!

               Gandhi, baffled a second, sees the outstretched hand above 
               them, and in puckish complicity, helps boost Charlie up.

               Long shot. As Charlie reaches up, his hand is grasped and he 
               starts to scramble and be pulled up to the roof.

               Featuring Gandhi and Ba. As Charlie's leg, assisted by Gandhi, 
               starts to leave its lodging on the window ledge Ba suddenly 
               turns, sees it, and grabs for it in alarm.

                                     BA
                         Charlie! Be careful!!

               Close shot. Charlie. His face flat on the roof of the train 
               as his arm is still gripped by the Indian, but his leg is 
               being pulled from behind.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (desperately)
                         Mohan -- !!

               Resume Gandhi and Ba. Gandhi quickly moves to free Ba's hand 
               from Charlie's leg and almost loses his own grip.

               He grabs the window again.

                                     GANDHI
                         Let go! You'll kill him!

               Ba is confused.

                                     GANDHI
                         Let go! Let go!

               With one hand he pries at her grip. In the chaos of 
               instructions others in the coach are helping Gandhi, and Ba 
               senses she is doing something wrong, but is still not sure 
               what. She lets go.

               Close shot. Charlie. A desperate sigh of relief.

               Long shot. Charlie is pulled on up to the top of the coach.

               Featuring Charlie as he sits, puffing and recovering from 
               the fright.

                                     FIRST INDIAN
                         You see -- most comfortable.

               Charlie nods grimly.

               Featuring Gandhi and Ba. Gandhi, smiling, goes on the tips 
               of his toes to get a better view. Ba grabs him desperately.

                                     BA
                         Please, God, no!

               Featuring Charlie. He looks around at the rest of the 
               passengers on the roof, their bundles and baskets clutched 
               beside them. Their poverty is appalling, but they are all 
               smiling at him, a sense of gaiety made in part by his 
               Englishman's participation in their experience. They must 
               shout over the train.

                                     SECOND INDIAN
                              (grinning)
                         Are you Christian, Sahib?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (nods)
                         Yes, yes, I'm a Christian.

                                     SECOND INDIAN
                              (proudly)
                         I know a Christian.
                              (Charlie acknowledges 
                              it politely.)
                         She drinks blood.

               Charlie stares at him in surprise.

                                     SECOND INDIAN
                              (explaining -- obvious)
                         The blood of Christ -- every Sunday!

               He is nodding, smiling, expecting Charlie's understanding. 
               And Charlie gives it -- somewhat bleakly. Suddenly

                                     GANDHI'S VOICE
                              (alarmed)
                         Charlie!!

               The Indians turn. Charlie turns.

               TRAIN AND TUNNEL - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Resume Charlie and the Indians.

                                     FIRST INDIAN
                         It's all right, Sahib! Very safe -- 
                         bend -- bend!

               All the Indians are crouching. Charlie closes his eyes 
               ruefully -- he's had better ideas than this -- and he gets 
               as flat as he can.

               TRAIN AND TUNNEL - EXTERIOR - DAY

               The train, with passengers clinging to the sides and riding 
               on the top, steams into the tunnel, its whistle sounding.

               THE TUNNEL

               Black. A glimmer of light, through steam, the whistle echoing.

                                     INDIAN'S VOICE
                         Pray to God, Sahib! Now is when it 
                         is best to be Hindu!

               Close shot. Charlie. In a flash of steamy light, staring 
               wide-eyed at the Indian.

               Black, and sudden silence.

                                                AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

               CONVENTION TENT - INTERIOR - DAY

               High. Coming into focus is a lighted platform, and as the 
               scene becomes clearer we see figures on the platform and the 
               banner which reads INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, and we hear the 
               emotional voice of Jinnah at the microphone.

                                     JINNAH
                              (gradually fading in)
                         We were asked for toleration. We 
                         were asked for patience. Some gave 
                         it and some did not. Well, their war 
                         is over! And those of us who supported 
                         it, and those of us who refused must 
                         forget our differences!

               The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in 
               close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid 
               delivery on the audience.

                                     JINNAH
                         And there can be no excuses from the 
                         British now! India wants Home Rule! 
                         India demands Home Rule!!

               And the audience cheers him. Newspaper cameramen crowded 
               around the platform photograph him. Patel comes forward from 
               the back of the platform, clapping. He is chairing the 
               Congress. Jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the 
               auditorium. A man made for the spotlight, a man loving the 
               spotlight.

               At last he moves back to his place on the platform. Nehru 
               clasps his hand in congratulation. Others crowd around him. 
               And fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see Gandhi -- 
               again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end 
               of the second row on the platform. He is just watching the 
               flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah.

               Featuring Patel approaching the microphone, stilling the 
               house with upraised hands.

                                     PATEL
                         And let no one question that Mr. 
                         Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims -- 
                         but for all India!

               And again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. 
               He raises his hands, stilling them again.

                                     PATEL
                         And now I'm going to introduce to 
                         you a man whose writings we are all 
                         becoming familiar with... a man who 
                         stood high in the esteem of our 
                         beloved Professor Gokhale... a man 
                         whose accomplishment in South Africa 
                         will always be remembered. Mr. 
                         Mohandas Gandhi.

               Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium. He is 
               greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is 
               performing like a convention now that the spell of Jinnah's 
               major speech has dissipated. As Gandhi reaches the podium, 
               Patel gestures him to it.

                                     PATEL
                              (politely)
                         Your journal has made a great impact.

               Gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause.

                                     GANDHI
                         I am flattered by Mr. Patel
                              (His grin.)
                         I would be even more flattered if 
                         what he said were true.

               He means about the journal.

               Patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already 
               on them. But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- 
               a smile, a politician's flexibility --

                                     PATEL
                              (loudly; he is away 
                              from the mike)
                         But it's true! I -- I read it... 
                         often.

               Again Gandhi grins -- and takes glasses from his sleeve. 
               This is the first time we have seen them. He has one slip of 
               paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium. He 
               puts his glasses on and faces the convention.

                                     GANDHI
                         Since I returned from South Africa, 
                         I have traveled over much of India. 
                         And I know I could travel many more 
                         years and still only see a small 
                         part of it.

               On the platform, the whispered politics go on. On the floor 
               of the convention, some listen, some talk of other things.

                                     GANDHI
                         ...and yet already I know what we 
                         say here means nothing to the masses 
                         of our country.

               Nehru has turned, having caught that last remark. He touches 
               Patel on the shoulder "Listen."

                                     GANDHI
                         Here we make speeches for each other -- 
                         and those English liberal magazines 
                         that may grant us a few lines.

               And now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of 
               the hall too.

                                     GANDHI
                         But the people of India are untouched. 
                         Their politics are confined to bread 
                         and salt.

               Jinnah too is listening now -- aloofly, challengingly.

                                     GANDHI
                         Illiterate they may be, but they are 
                         not blind. They see no reason to 
                         give their loyalty to rich and 
                         powerful men who simply want to take 
                         over the role of the British in the 
                         name of freedom.

               There is dissent on the floor and on the platform -- but it 
               is muttered and English "polite." Gandhi goes on.

                                     GANDHI
                         This Congress tells the world it 
                         represents India. My brothers, India 
                         is seven hundred thousand "villages" 
                         not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi 
                         and Bombay. Until we stand in the 
                         fields with the millions who toil 
                         each day under the hot sun, we will 
                         not represent India -- nor will we 
                         ever be able to challenge the British 
                         as one nation.

               He takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts 
               back toward his place on the platform. A cameraman flashes a 
               picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here 
               and there, tepidly. On the platform, the leaders join in 
               perfunctorily. We see one peasant face (Shukla) -- which we 
               will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders 
               who stand in the doorways.

               Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some 
               surprise turns to Patel.

                                     NEHRU
                         Have you read his magazine?

                                     PATEL
                         No -- but I think I'm going to.

               THE TRAIL TO GANDHI'S ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

               An open touring car struggling along the bumpy trail. Nehru 
               drives, four friends as young as he with him, all dressed in 
               the same expensive, British manner.

                                     FIRST FRIEND
                         This can't be the way!

               Nehru is looking a little harassed, from the ragging he is 
               taking and from the ride. The ashram is only half-finished, 
               the ground unworked, the buildings only partially completed 
               and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost. 
               They are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is tethered 
               right across the path.

                              (a mocking quote)
                         Yes, I'm sure this is the direction 
                         India is taking.

               The others laugh; Nehru suffers.

                                     SECOND FRIEND
                         To think I almost got excited by Mr. 
                         Jinnah when all this was awaiting 
                         me.

               ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Nehru has half risen in his seat to address Charlie Andrews, 
               who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has 
               stopped dead at the sight of the car. He carries sheaves of 
               page proofs.

                                     NEHRU
                         We're looking for Mr. Gandhi!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ah, you'll find him under the tree 
                         by the river.
                              (He points off, then 
                              glances at the car.)
                         You'd better leave the car -- the 
                         ground is rather soft.

                                     NEHRU
                         Thank you . . .

               He looks around the ashram a little dismally.

                                     FIRST FRIEND
                              (drolly, as he climbs 
                              out)
                         Come on! I'm anxious to meet this 
                         new "force"!

               ASHRAM - TREE BY RIVER - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi sits under a tree, peeling potatoes. Nehru and his 
               friends are sprawled out around him. Beside them, the river; 
               in the background the business of the ashram goes on.

                                     GANDHI
                         I try to live like an Indian, as you 
                         see... it is stupid of course, because 
                         in our country it is the British who 
                         decide how an Indian lives -- what 
                         he may buy, what he may sell. And 
                         from their luxury in the midst of 
                         our terrible poverty they instruct 
                         us on what is justice and what is 
                         sedition.
                              (He looks at them, a 
                              teasing but mordant 
                              grin.)
                         So it is only natural that our best 
                         young minds assume an air of Eastern 
                         dignity, while greedily assimilating 
                         every Western weakness as quickly as 
                         they can acquire it.

               His smile is sardonic, but genuine, theirs embarrassed and 
               self-conscious.

                                     NEHRU
                              (defensively)
                         If we have Home Rule that will change.

               Gandhi has finished the last potato. He glances at Nehru 
               then drops the potato in the bowl. He lifts the pail of 
               peelings to Nehru.

                                     GANDHI
                         Would you, please?

               Nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly. His 
               friends watch with amusement, but they too rise to follow as 
               they head for the kitchen.

                                     GANDHI
                         And why should the English grant us 
                         Home Rule? Here, we must take the 
                         peelings to the goats.

               He re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats 
               are tethered, but he keeps right on talking.

                                     GANDHI
                         We only make wild speeches, or perform 
                         even wilder acts of terrorism. We've 
                         bred an army of anarchists but not 
                         one single group that can really 
                         fight the British anywhere.

                                     NEHRU
                              (surprised)
                         I thought you were against fighting.

               They have reached the trough.

                                     GANDHI
                         Just spread it around -- they like 
                         the new peelings mixed with the 
                         rotting ones.

               Nehru has carefully walked around something distasteful on 
               the ground, now he dumps the peelings along the trough and 
               spreads them "delicately." Gandhi scoops some peelings from 
               the trough to feed a goat that nudges him.

                                     GANDHI
                         Where there is injustice, I've always 
                         believed in fighting.
                              (He looks at Nehru.)
                         The question is do you fight to change 
                         things, or do you fight to punish.
                              (His smile.)
                         For myself, I have found that we are 
                         all such sinners we should leave 
                         punishment to God. And if we really 
                         want to change things there are better 
                         ways of doing it than by derailing 
                         trains or slashing someone with a 
                         sword.

               He meets Nehru's gaze, and for a moment something deeper 
               than argument passes between them. Then something catches 
               Gandhi's eye. He looks off. Ba stands, watching him, waiting.

                                     BA
                         The fire is ready.

               Gandhi turns. The goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes. 
               He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen.

                                     GANDHI
                         You see, even here we live under 
                         tyranny.

               Nehru grins, captured by Gandhi's seriousness, and his humor. 
               He hasn't moved, and neither have his friends. They watch 
               Gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to Ba.

                                     NEHRU
                              (reflectively)
                         I told you...

                                     FIRST FRIEND
                         Hm... but look at him. Some "fighter"! 
                         I can see the British shaking now.

               Gandhi plods on toward the kitchen, carrying the bowl of 
               potatoes.

               THE RIVER BED AT THE ASHRAM - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Clothes are dipped in the brownish water. Ba and an ashramite 
               woman squat by the river, washing clothes. It is long past 
               the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed 
               to the water. But they are laughing at their task.

                                     BA
                         But it's the ink that is the most 
                         diffic --

               She stops, because coming along the riverbed toward them is 
               a man (Shukla) who looks as though he has come a long, weary 
               way. His face is gaunt, his little bundle of belongings 
               pathetic. As he nears them, he pauses.

                                     SHUKLA
                         I am looking for Mr. Gandhi...

               GANDHI'S HUT - ASHRAM - INTERIOR - DUSK

               Shadowed, the end of the day. Gandhi sits cross-legged, 
               watching solemnly as Shukla reaches with his fingers into a 
               bowl to eat. The fingers are thin, half-starved, like the 
               man himself.

                                     SHUKLA
                         ...I've wanted to speak to you for a 
                         long time.

               He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly. He does not eat 
               yet, but his hunger is evident. Ba sits at one side in the 
               shadows watching him as intently as Gandhi.

                                     SHUKLA
                         ...our crops... we can't sell them... 
                         We have no money... but the landlords 
                         take the same rent.

               His voice is choked and near to tears, resonant with the 
               unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like 
               him. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts 
               the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying 
               desperately not to show it.

               Close shot. Ba. The solemn intensity of her gaze reflects 
               her identification with the man's agony. She glances up at 
               Gandhi...

               TRAIN STATION - CHAMPARAN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

               The camera is low, shooting along the track toward the light 
               of an approaching train. From its distant glow we can see 
               that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, 
               but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be.

               The station house. An open staff car pulls up through the 
               press of the crowd. An English captain leaps out and pushes 
               aggressively through the mass of bodies toward the platform. 
               Again the darkness of the ill-lit station and the angle of 
               the camera limit our vision.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Clear the way there! Get out of the 
                         way!

               A detail of British troops, already on the station, moves in 
               his wake, just as aggressive toward the crowd as he is.

                                     SERGEANT PUTNAM
                         Sir! Up here!

               The sergeant is on the low sloping roof of the station. The 
               captain turns briskly to two of his detail.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Give me a leg up, will you!

               The two men join hands and the captain is hoisted up with an 
               assist from Sergeant Putnam. We hear the train stop in the 
               background.

               On the roof. The captain stands erect.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         What the hell is it, Sergeant?

               He is now standing and his face has frozen. It needs no answer 
               from Putnam.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Jesus...!

               He turns his head slowly, his mouth agape at His point of 
               view. The whole of the obscurely lit platform is covered 
               thick with waiting crowds. They engulf the station house, 
               back and front, and on the other side of the train more people 
               are packed all along its length, and beyond them along the 
               narrow street that stretches through the little collection 
               of houses adjoining the station, every rooftop is covered -- 
               men, women with babes in arms, children. There is no 
               excitement, hardly any movement -- just a vast congregation 
               of people, waiting silently is the darkness -- and as the 
               camera pans we see that the crowd extends, indiscernible, 
               even beyond the range of light.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                              (awed, a little 
                              frightened)
                         What the hell is going on?

                                     SERGEANT PUTNAM
                         I don't know, sir. The agent says 
                         they got a telegram and it just said, 
                         he is coming... and gave the time of 
                         the train.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Who the hell is he?

                                     SERGEANT PUTNAM
                         I don't know, sir.

               Featuring Gandhi. He has stepped down from the train. Shukla 
               guides him, Ba and Charlie a step or two behind. Gandhi moves 
               through the silent crowd, his hands in the pranam, bowing a 
               little to either side. As he advances, the crowd parts -- it 
               is almost eerily silent. As their clothes indicate, the area 
               is Muslim, so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the 
               forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to Gandhi 
               as he moves through them. Most of the faces are gaunt and 
               lean. A destitute people.

               And suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on 
               the concrete platform, and the English captain shoves his 
               way through to confront Gandhi down the little aisle that 
               was being made for him. The sergeant and part of the detail 
               and behind the captain.

               The captain stares. Then he looks around at the crowd, 
               suspiciously, a touch of inner fear, then back to Gandhi.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Who the devil are you?

                                     GANDHI
                         My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi.

               There is a flicker of recognition, but uncertain. The captain 
               stiffens; a steeling of the will. Another glance at the crowd, 
               this time with an air of outraged authority.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Well, whoever you are, we don't want 
                         you here. I suggest you get back on 
                         that train before it leaves the 
                         station.

                                     GANDHI
                              (calmly, a glance at 
                              the crowd)
                         They seem to want me.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Now look here. I'll put you under 
                         arrest if you'd prefer?

                                     GANDHI
                         On what charge?

               It has the cold assurance of a lawyer, and the Captain is a 
               little shaken by it. He glances at Charlie who stands behind 
               Gandhi now, and it makes him all the more uncertain.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         I don't want any trouble.

               He tries to make it severe, but it is a comedown.

                                     GANDHI
                         I am an Indian traveling in my own 
                         country. I see no reason for trouble.

               It is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it that 
               the Captain doesn't like, but Gandhi's unrelenting stare 
               unnerves him. He glances at Charlie again.

                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN
                         Well, there'd better not be.

               Again, the empty severity of weakness. He looks around, then 
               turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the 
               crowd. "Out of my way, there! Come on, move!"

               Gandhi smiles reflectively, and the crowd suddenly begins to 
               buzz. Where all was silence before there is now the hum of 
               excitement. Already he has scored a victory -- and as he 
               moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with 
               flushed greetings. "Gandhi -- Gandhi -- Bapu -- Gandhiji"...

               PEASANT'S DWELLING - INTERIOR - DAY

               The early light of the sun illumines the dwelling. We feature 
               a man in middle age, but one who looks ill and drawn (Meha). 
               He lies on a straw mat.

                                     MEHA
                         For years the landlords have ordered 
                         us to grow indigo, for dyeing the 
                         cloth. Always they took part of the 
                         crop as rent.

               Gandhi sits cross-legged, listening. It is the kind of 
               listening that opens the heart. Behind him a mass of villagers 
               sits stoically, outside the dwelling, waiting while their 
               case is heard. Meha tries to speak unemotionally but under 
               Gandhi's sympathetic gaze his despair keeps cracking through.

                                     MEHA
                         But now the English factories make 
                         cloth for everyone. No one wants our 
                         indigo. And the landlords won't take 
                         their share. They say we must pay 
                         our rent in cash.

               Near to breakdown, he gestures around the empty house.

                                     MEHA
                         What we could, we sold... The police 
                         have taken the rest. There is no 
                         food, we --

               He cannot go on.

                                     GANDHI
                         I understand.
                              (He examines his hands 
                              a moment.)
                         The landlords are British?

               It's a rhetorical question. Meha nods.

               Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling, almost nothing 
               remains. We see two young men, one seventeen perhaps, the 
               other older, and a girl, sixteen. And finally Meha's wife, 
               sitting near Ba, the two women listening together but Meha's 
               wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead 
               and hardly combed, her sari dirty.

               Meha looks at Gandhi and shakes his head hopelessly. Gandhi 
               nods... He stands slowly.

                                     GANDHI
                         What we can do... we will try to do.

               The words are said bleakly, not to raise false hopes. He 
               glances at Meha's wife. Water comes to her eyes, and she 
               lowers her head. Ba puts her hands on her shoulders and clasps 
               her to her, and the woman breaks, and sobs and sobs...

               TILLED FIELD - CHAMPARAN - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Gandhi rides on an open howdah on an elephant, his mind locked 
               in sober reflection. Shukla shares the howdah with him, but 
               does not dare break Gandhi's black mood.

                                     GANDHI
                         Is all Champaran like this, Shukla?

                                     SHUKLA
                         Yes, Bapu...
                              (He looks across the 
                              field.)
                         The whole province... hundreds -- 
                         thousands.

               It registers with Gandhi -- but inside. A moment.

                                     CHARLIE'S VOICE
                         Mohan -- !

               Gandhi shakes himself from his absorption and looks back. Ba 
               and Charlie are mounted on a similar howdah on another 
               elephant, both being led by peasant boys. Charlie is pointing 
               behind them. Coming along the path is a tall Indian policeman 
               on a bicycle. He rides right past Charlie and Ba and comes 
               alongside Gandhi. His attitude is superficially polite, but 
               he is full of righteous authority.

                                     POLICEMAN
                              (he knows)
                         Are you Mr. M. K. Gandhi?

                                     GANDHI
                         Yes.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         I'm sorry but you are under arrest.

                                     GANDHI
                         I am not sorry at all.

               It contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone 
               but Ba.

               CHAMPARAN CRICKET CLUB - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A ball is hit. The camera pulls back to reveal a lush, verdant 
               pitch, white-garbed players, English, a few ladies dressed 
               in First World War fashion watching under parasols near the 
               clubhouse and in the shade of trees with a few officers and 
               civil servants, while Indian servants discreetly serve cool 
               drinks.

               The batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch 
               with his partner until the four is certain, then

                                     BATSMAN
                              (to the wicket keeper)
                         Who did you say would be buying the 
                         drinks?

               The wicket keeper makes a rude, facetious gesture, but as 
               the batsman turns to settle in his crease again

                                     BATSMAN
                         Oh, no --

               He has looked up. A car is pulling hurriedly in near the 
               clubhouse, an officer in it, and people are streaming toward 
               it.

               The car. A major is standing on the back seat. An Indian 
               corporal drives.

                                     MAJOR
                         ...I've got no idea. All I know is 
                         there's a riot or something at 
                         Motihari in Champaran, and the whole 
                         company is ordered out.

                                     A VOICE
                         It's two days' march!

                                     MAJOR
                         That's why the match is off. It's 
                         mostly Muslim territory and the old 
                         man's taking no chances.

               Featuring the batsman and some of the players as they walk 
               across the field toward the car. They know something's up.

                                     BATSMAN
                              (disgusted)
                         God, and it's the best innings I've 
                         had since Oxford.

                                     WICKET KEEPER
                              (dryly)
                         India's full of grief, old man.

               The batsman "takes" on him facetiously, and we cut to:

               THE COURTHOUSE AND JAIL - MOTIHARI - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A small building on a little Anglicized square. It is 
               surrounded by a milling angry throng of peasants.

               Featuring the front entrance. The English captain who was at 
               the station when Gandhi arrived is on the top step, looking 
               harried and tense. A small detachment of Indian troops lines 
               the step below him. Charlie Andrews is pushing through the 
               crowd toward the captain. As he approaches, the Indian 
               sergeant holds up his hand.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (firmly)
                         I wish to see the prisoner, please.

               The captain looks at his clerical collar, his English face, 
               his determination.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (reluctantly)
                         All right, Sergeant.

               Charlie moves through the Indian soldiers and up toward the 
               entrance. The captain stares out worriedly over the unruly 
               crowd.

               COURTHOUSE JAIL - INTERIOR - DAY

               A basement chamber -- dark, thick-walled and poorly lit. The 
               camera has panned off a close shot of Gandhi as he turns in 
               his cell at the sound of a door opening and approaching 
               footsteps. We have seen only his head and shoulders, which 
               are covered in a shawl.

               A police guard leads Charlie across the rough, unfinished 
               floor. As he comes to Gandhi's cell we get a fleeting glimpse 
               of Gandhi sitting on a low pallet bed.

               Close shot. Gandhi as he recognizes his visitor.

                                     GANDHI
                         Charlie--

               Reverse on Charlie. He looks down at Gandhi and shakes his 
               head.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (a somber grin)
                         ...Shades of South Africa.

               Close shot. Gandhi. Head and shoulders. He returns the grin, 
               but anger and determination still dominate his mood.

                                     GANDHI
                         Not quite. They're only "holding me" 
                         until the Magistrate's hearing. Then 
                         it will be prison.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (sympathetically)
                         Did they take your clothes?

               And now we see Gandhi in full shot for the first time. He is 
               wearing only a white loincloth, the shawl over his shoulders 
               and sandals -- the costume he will wear for the rest of his 
               life.

                                     GANDHI
                         These are my clothes now.

               Charlie studies him a moment, and being Charlie, he 
               understands.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (affectionately)
                         You always had a puritanical streak, 
                         Mohan.

               He grins, and it elicits a little grin from Gandhi.

                                     GANDHI
                              (in a tone of 
                              defensiveness)
                         If I want to be one with them, I 
                         have to live like them.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think you do.
                              (A smile.)
                         But I thank God we all don't.

               And Gandhi laughs.

                                     GANDHI
                         I'm sure your legs are quite as 
                         handsome as mine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ah, but my puritanism runs the another 
                         way. I'm far too modest for such a 
                         display.

               And again Gandhi laughs. Charlie turns to the guard.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Couldn't I be let in with the 
                         prisoner? I am a clergyman.

               The police guard hesitates, and then unlocks the cell.

               Charlie enters and sits on a little wooden stool opposite 
               Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly filling most of the space 
               between them. Gandhi has remained seated, pensive. Charlie 
               studies him a moment.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (a bit puzzled)
                         They're calling you "Bapu." I thought 
                         it meant father.

                                     GANDHI
                              (wistfully)
                         It does. We must be getting old, 
                         Charlie.

               A little grin, but his mood remains pensive -- and remote.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you want me to do?

               Gandhi looks up -- his anger, his determination there, but 
               then broken by a hopeless sigh.

                                     GANDHI
                         I think, Charlie, that you can help 
                         us most by taking that assignment 
                         you've been offered in Fiji.

               Charlie is stunned, and obviously hurt. Gandhi proceeds more 
               gently.

                                     GANDHI
                         I have to be sure -- they have to be 
                         sure -- that what we do can be done 
                         by Indians... alone.

               And now Charlie understands. Gandhi smiles; warmth, and 
               sadness. Then he speaks with a determined purposefulness, a 
               friend's trust.

                                     GANDHI
                         But you know the strategy. The world 
                         is full of people who will despise 
                         what's happening here. It is their 
                         strength we need. Before you go, you 
                         could start us in the right direction.

               He has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and 
               handed them to Charlie. Charlie nods. He sighs, and rises 
               slowly.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I must leave from Calcutta, and soon. 
                         You'll have to say goodbye to Ba for 
                         me.

               Gandhi rises, glancing wryly at the prison walls. He nods.

                                     GANDHI
                         When I get the chance.

               And now he faces Charlie; this is the moment of farewell.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well, I --

               He doesn't know what to say, how to say it. Gandhi meets his 
               eyes -- a smile that shelters Charlie's vulnerability, returns 
               his love.

                                     GANDHI
                         There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie. 
                         Wherever you are, you will always be 
                         in my heart...

               The very English, very steadfast Charlie fights to contain 
               his emotions.

               THE COURTROOM - MOTIHARI - INTERIOR - DAY

               It is packed to overflowing; restless. Gandhi sits in the 
               dock. One or two sergeants-at-arms are trying to keep order, 
               but it the uneven and menacing chanting of "Gandhi... Gandhi" 
               coming from the mobs outside the courtroom that fills the 
               atmosphere with threat.

               The magistrate (English) is surveying the courtroom; he 
               signals his clerk (English) to him.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                              (whispered conference)
                         I am going to clear the courtroom.

                                     CLERK
                              (politely)
                         I'm not sure we'd be able to. And it 
                         is a first hearing, it's supposed to 
                         be public. And he's a lawyer.

               The magistrate frowns.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                              (worried, angry)
                         I don't know where they found the 
                         nerve for all this.

                                     CLERK
                         I'm sure I don't either, but the 
                         troops won't be here until tomorrow.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         How the press get here before the 
                         military?

               We see the front row from his point of view. Two or three 
               Indian journalists and one European.

                                     CLERK
                         That English clergyman sent a number 
                         of telegrams yesterday afternoon. I 
                         understand one of them even went to 
                         the Viceroy.

               The magistrate receives that news with some alarm. He 
               indicates that the clerk take his place.

               Gandhi stands. The courtroom is silent, but we can still 
               hear the sound of the chanting outside.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         You have been ordered out of the 
                         province on the grounds of disturbing 
                         the peace.

                                     GANDHI
                              (defiantly)
                         With respect, I refuse to go.

               The magistrate stares. The journalists write. The clerk 
               swallows.

               The magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too 
               aware of the mob outside.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                              (sternly)
                         Do you want to go to jail?

                                     GANDHI
                              (not giving him an 
                              inch)
                         As you wish.

               The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad. The magistrate searches 
               the distant wall, the top of his desk, his twitching hands 
               for an answer. Finally

                                     MAGISTRATE
                              (as much sternness as 
                              he can muster)
                         All right. I will release you on 
                         bail of one hundred rupees until I 
                         reach a sentence.

                                     GANDHI
                         I refuse to pay one hundred rupees.

               Again the magistrate stares. And so do the journalists. The 
               magistrate wets his lips --

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Then I -- I will grant release without 
                         bail -- until I reach a decision.

               And now the court explodes. In the chaos of cheering and 
               delight, the magistrate rises, looks around the room and 
               heads for his chambers.

               The journalists are scribbling furiously.

               Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom. We hear cries 
               of "Gandhi! -- Gandhi! -- Bapu!"

               THE COURTHOUSE BALCONY

               Gandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony. A huge 
               cheer comes up from the massed peasants below. As he smiles 
               down at them, he is turned by

                                     A VOICE
                         Gandhiji! -- Gandhiji! Mr. Gandhi!

               Four young Indians -- elegantly dressed in English clothes -- 
               are following him, having plunged through the crowd in the 
               courtroom. A beat -- and the first young man addresses him 
               over the chaos.

                                     FIRST YOUNG MAN
                              (his accent is as 
                              refined as his clothes)
                         Gandhiji -- we are from Bihar. We 
                         received a cable this morning from 
                         an old friend who was at Cambridge 
                         with us.
                              (A smile.)
                         His name is Nehru and I believe you 
                         know him.

               Gandhi reacts -- with surprise and caution.

                                     GANDHI
                         Indeed.

                                     FIRST YOUNG MAN
                         He tells us you need help. And we 
                         have come to give it.

               Again Gandhi is surprised -- but even more cautious. Behind 
               him, the crowd begins to chant "Gandhi -- Gandhi."

                                     GANDHI
                         I want to document, coldly, 
                         rationally, what is being done here. 
                         It may take months -- many, many 
                         months.

                                     FIRST YOUNG MAN
                              (they're eager, 
                              impressed)
                         We have no pressing engagements.

               It sounds casually ironic, but they look determined, even 
               angry.

                                     GANDHI
                         You will have to live with the 
                         peasants.
                              (They nod.)
                         I have nothing to pay you.
                              (They only smile.)
                         Hmm.

               He is looking at them with a soupon of skepticism but he is 
               beginning to smell victory. His name echoes around him and 
               is taken up even louder as the news spreads to the street.

               GOVERNOR'S OFFICE - CHAMPARAN - INTERIOR - DAY

               Almost total silence. The room is long, large and imposing -- 
               hardwood floors, overhead fans, an aura of wealth and 
               permanence. Footsteps pace its acres of space... and Sir 
               George Hodge comes into frame. He is rich, middle-aged, Tory -- 
               and at the moment feeling impotent and harried.

                                     SIR GEORGE
                         I don't know what this country is 
                         coming to!

               The Governor, Sir Edward Gait -- the portrait of the King 
               prominent behind him -- is feeling as cornered as Sir George 
               but for different reasons. His desk is arrayed with several 
               tall stacks of folders -- all with exactly the same covers -- 
               and on one corner of the desk, some folded newspapers. We 
               can just read "Gandhi" in a headline. He taps one of the 
               folders irritably with his hand.

                                     SIR EDWARD
                         But good God, man, you yourself raised 
                         the rent simply to finance a hunting 
                         expedition!

               Sir George looks at him -- half defensive, half defiant. 
               They are old friends -- the same school, the same social 
               class, long together in India -- and their argument is an 
               argument between friend who accept the same premises. But 
               even so the Governor feels the game has not quite been played 
               fairly.

                                     SIR EDWARD
                         And some of these others --
                              (he gestures to the 
                              folders again)
                         beatings, illegal seizures, demanding 
                         services without pay, even refusing 
                         them water! In India!...

               Sir George is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling 
               but defensive.

                                     SIR GEORGE
                         Nobody knows what it is to try to 
                         get these people to work!

                                     SIR EDWARD
                         Well, you've make this half-naked 
                         whatever-he-is into an international 
                         hero.

               He picks up one of the papers irritatedly, the London Daily 
               Chronicle.

                                     SIR EDWARD
                         "One lone man marching dusty roads 
                         armed only with honesty and a bamboo 
                         shaft doing battle with the British 
                         Empire."
                              (He lowers the paper 
                              dismally; then the 
                              ultimate bitterness)
                         At home children are writing "essays" 
                         about him.

               Sir George looks at him and sighs heavily. Sir Edward stares 
               back, then drops the paper back on his desk.

                                     SIR EDWARD
                         I couldn't take another two years of 
                         him to save my life.

               Sir George turns, and paces back toward him. For the first 
               time we see Sir Edward's personal secretary (a male civil 
               servant) sitting at a small desk and listening with highly 
               developed unobtrusiveness.

                                     SIR GEORGE
                         What do they want?

               It is the first sign of concession. Sir Edward lifts his 
               eyes to his personal secretary.

                                     PERSONAL SECRETARY
                              (reading precisely 
                              from a document)
                         A rebate on rents paid.
                              (Sir George huffs.)
                         They are to be free to grow crops of 
                         their own choice. A commission -- 
                         part Indian -- to hear grievances.

               Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward. A beat.

                                     SIR GEORGE
                              (wearily)
                         That would satisfy him?...

                                     SIR EDWARD
                              (a nod; then pointedly)
                         And His Majesty's Government. It 
                         only needs your signature for the 
                         landlords.

               Sir George looks at the document on the secretary's desk. A 
               moment. The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him. 
               Sir George looks at it like a snake. The secretary picks up 
               a pen and offers it. A second, then Sir George takes the pen 
               and signs angrily.

                                     SIR GEORGE
                         It will be worth it to see the back 
                         of him.
                              (A flourish at the 
                              end of his signature, 
                              then he stands.)
                         We're too damn liberal.

               Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet.

                                     SIR EDWARD
                         Perhaps. But at least all this has 
                         made the Government see some sense 
                         about what men like Mr. Gandhi should 
                         be allowed, and what they should be 
                         denied.

               He turns, offering Sir George a whiskey in a finely cut glass 
               of crystal.

                                     SIR EDWARD
                              (firmly)
                         Things are going to change.

               JINNAH'S RESIDENCE - BOMBAY - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Jinnah moves from under the portico. His shining, expensive 
               car is coming in the drive and stops by him. He opens the 
               back door, but only the chauffeur is in the car.

                                     JINNAH
                              (in annoyance)
                         Where is Mr. Gandhi?

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                              (distastefully)
                         He said he preferred to walk, sir. I 
                         followed him most of the way. He's 
                         just turned the corner.

               Jinnah closes the door and looks across at the entrance in 
               exasperation.

                                     JINNAH
                         The Prophet give me patience.

                                     CHAUFFEUR
                         He came Third Class.

               It's a disdainful comment and he drives the car off toward 
               the garage.

               Gandhi comes around the corner of the wall into the entrance. 
               He is carrying a bedroll and a bamboo walking stick. Herman 
               Kallenbach is with him, dressed informally, also carrying a 
               bedroll. Jinnah makes a "sophisticated" salaam.

                                     JINNAH
                              (with effort)
                         My house is honored.

               Gandhi grins, dismissing the formality.

                                     GANDHI
                              (he makes the pranam)
                         The honor is ours. May I introduce 
                         Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend
                              (anticipating Jinnah's 
                              objection)
                         and his interest is in flowers. I 
                         presumed to tell him he could wander 
                         your gardens while we talked.

                                     JINNAH
                              (the suave, but 
                              slightly ironic host)
                         I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll 
                         have much to discuss.

               JINNAH'S DRAWING ROOM - INTERIOR - DAY

               It is spacious, "English." At the door, Jinnah introduces 
               Gandhi to the room.

                                     JINNAH
                         Gentlemen -- the hero of Champaran.

               Again Gandhi grins at the extravagance.

                                     GANDHI
                         Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

               A polite little laugh; Jinnah introduces him.

                                     JINNAH
                         Mr. Patel you know.
                              (Patel bows.)
                         Mr. Maulana Azad -- a fellow Muslim... 
                         recently released from prison.

               Gandhi makes the pranam, studying him with interest after 
               that comment. Azad gives a gentle salaam.

                                     JINNAH
                         Mr. Kripalani.
                              (A bow -- we have 
                              seen him at the 
                              Congress Conference.)
                         And of course you know Mr. Nehru.

               Gandhi turns.

               Featuring Nehru. He stands, awaiting Gandhi's attention. All 
               the others have been dressed in European clothes. The handsome 
               Europeanized Nehru now wears an Indian tunic -- much like 
               the one that Gandhi once wore.

               For a moment Gandhi studies the costume, then a broad smile.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a play on Jinnah's 
                              introduction)
                         I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

                                     PATEL
                              (to business: Gandhi 
                              has been admitted to 
                              the power circle, he 
                              is not the power)
                         Well, I've called you here because 
                         I've had a chance to see the new 
                         legislation. It's exactly what was 
                         rumored. Arrest without warrant. 
                         Automatic imprisonment for possession 
                         of materials considered seditious...

               He looks at Gandhi.

                                     PATEL
                         Your writings are specifically listed.

               Gandhi nods at the "compliment," but they are all angered by 
               the severity of it.

                                     KRIPALANI
                         So much for helping them in the Great 
                         War...

                                     JINNAH
                              (fire)
                         There is only one answer to that. 
                         Direct action -- on a scale they can 
                         never handle!

               Again the temper of it produces a little silence. Then

                                     NEHRU
                         I don't think so.

               He moves to a servant who stands, holding a large tray with 
               a silver service of tea. Of them all, Nehru's manner is the 
               most naturally patrician and Jinnah watches him with a 
               somewhat envious awareness of it.

                                     NEHRU
                         Terrorism would only justify their 
                         repression. And what kinds of leaders 
                         would it throw up? Are they likely 
                         to be the men we would want at the 
                         head of our country?

               His stand has produced a little shock of surprise. Holding 
               his tea, he turns to Gandhi with a little smile.

                                     NEHRU
                         I've been catching up on my reading.

               He means Gandhi's of course. Jinnah looks at the two of them. 
               Gandhi has removed his sandals and is sitting cross-legged 
               on a fine upholstered chair. Jinnah's eyes rake him with 
               anger and distaste.

                                     JINNAH
                              (coldly)
                         I too have read Mr. Gandhi's writings, 
                         but I'd rather be ruled by an Indian 
                         terrorist than an English one. And I 
                         don't want to submit to that kind of 
                         law.

                                     PATEL
                              (to Nehru -- 
                              diplomatically -- 
                              but with a trace of 
                              condescension)
                         I must say, Panditji, it seems to me 
                         it's gone beyond remedies like passive 
                         resistance.

                                     GANDHI
                              (in the silence)
                         If I may -- I, for one, have never 
                         advocated passive anything.

               They all look at him with some surprise. As he speaks, he 
               rises and walks to the servant.

                                     GANDHI
                         I am with Mr. Jinnah. We must never 
                         submit to such laws -- ever. And I 
                         think our resistance must be active 
                         and provocative.

               They all stare at him, startled by his words and the fervor 
               with which he speaks to them.

                                     GANDHI
                         I want to embarrass all those who 
                         wish to treat us as slaves. All of 
                         them.

               He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and 
               with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it 
               on the table next to him. It makes them all aware that the 
               servant, standing there like an insensate ornament, has been 
               treated like a "thing," a slave. As it sinks in, Gandhi pours 
               some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -- 
               first to Jinnah.

                                     GANDHI
                         Forgive my stupid illustration. But 
                         I want to change their minds -- not 
                         kill them for weaknesses we all 
                         possess.

               It impresses each one of them. But for all his impact, they 
               still take the measure of him with caution.

                                     AZAD
                         And what "resistance" would you offer?

                                     GANDHI
                         The law is due to take effect from 
                         April sixth. I want to call on the 
                         nation to make that a day of prayer 
                         and fasting.

               "Prayer and fasting"? They are not overwhelmed.

                                     JINNAH
                         You mean a general strike?

                                     GANDHI
                              (his grin)
                         I mean a day of prayer and fasting. 
                         But of course no work could be done -- 
                         no buses, no trains, no factories, 
                         no administration. The country would 
                         stop.

               Patel is the first to recognize the implications.

                                     PATEL
                         My God, it would terrify them...

                                     AZAD
                              (a wry smile)
                         Three hundred fifty million people 
                         at prayer. Even the English newspapers 
                         would have to report that. And explain 
                         why.

                                     KRIPALANI
                         But could we get people to do it?

                                     NEHRU
                              (he is half sold 
                              already)
                         Champaran stirred the whole country.
                              (To Gandhi)
                         They are calling you Mahatma -- the 
                         Great Soul.

                                     GANDHI
                         Fortunately such news comes very 
                         slowly where I live.

                                     NEHRU
                              (continuing, to the 
                              others)
                         I think if we all worked to publicize 
                         it... all of the Congress... every 
                         avenue we know.

               The idea has caught hold. As the others talk of "papers," 
               "telegrams," "speeches," Jinnah looks over his cup at Gandhi 
               with an air of bitter resignation, but he tries to make light 
               of it.

                                     JINNAH
                         Perhaps I should have stayed in the 
                         garden and talked about the flowers.

               THE GARDEN - VICEROY'S PALACE - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A garden party in full imperial splendor. A military band 
               plays discreetly in the background. Princes, maharajahs, 
               generals, ranking British civil servants and their ladies 
               taking tea on the manicured lawns among the exotic flowers. 
               But over all there is a thread of anxiety, we pick up one or 
               two nervous phrases: "At the West Gate there were no taxis 
               at all!," "Of course, the Army will always be loyal." And 
               the camera picks out a civil servant stepping from a door of 
               the palace carrying a sheaf of telegrams and cable forms.

               He searches the assembled guests, then heads with almost 
               indecorous haste toward his target. It is the Viceroy, Lord 
               Chelmsford. With him, talking quietly, are his aide-de-camp, 
               the Governor of the province and his ADC, and the commanding 
               general of the Army in India. Lord Chelmsford's ADC is the 
               first to react to the civil servant's arrival and his 
               impatient attendance.

                                     ADC
                         Sir -- it's Mr. Kinnoch.

               Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Yes?

                                     KINNOCH
                              (hesitant, stunned)
                         Nothing... nothing is working, sir -- 
                         buses... trains... the markets...
                              (Personal, incredulous)
                         There's not even any civilian staff 
                         here, sir... Everything has stopped.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (curt, firm)
                         Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

               His firmness doesn't restore Kinnoch's normal aplomb. He 
               holds the telegrams forward.

                                     KINNOCH
                         No, sir -- Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, 
                         Bangalore. It's, it's total.

               He glances at the general.

                                     KINNOCH
                              (the ultimate)
                         The Army had to take over the 
                         telegraph or we'd be cut off from 
                         the world.

               That takes the wind out of all of them. Grimly, Lord 
               Chelmsford looks out across the palace's ordered lawns and 
               gardens.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         I can't believe it...

                                     KINNOCH
                         He's going to sell his own paper 
                         tomorrow in Bombay. They've called 
                         for a parade -- on Victoria Road.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (clenches his jaw and 
                              turns to the General)
                         Arrest him!

               THE JAIL - BOMBAY - INTERIOR - DAY

               A prison door opens. Gandhi, in prison clothes, is led along 
               a small corridor to a room. The door is held open by a prison 
               guard.

               ROOM - THE JAIL - BOMBAY - INTERIOR - DAY

               Nehru waits for Gandhi. He rises when Gandhi enters. The 
               guard signals Gandhi to a chair across a small wooden table 
               from Nehru. The guard closes the door, but remains in the 
               room. Nehru's face is a map of concern, but he manages a 
               small smile of greeting.

                                     NEHRU
                         Bapu...

               Gandhi, who also looks worn, rises his eyebrows whimsically 
               at the use of that name.

                                     GANDHI
                         You too...

               He means "Bapu" -- "Father."

                                     NEHRU
                              (a real smile, but 
                              the same affection)
                         It seems less formal than "Mahatma."

               Gandhi sighs, and their faces and minds go to more somber 
               matters.

                                     NEHRU
                         Since your arrest the riots have 
                         hardly stopped. Not big --; but they 
                         keep breaking out. I run to stop 
                         them... and Patel and Kripalani -- 
                         they are never at rest. But some 
                         English civilians have been killed, 
                         and the Army is attacking crowds 
                         with clubs -- and sometimes worse.

               Gandhi has listened to it all with a growing sense of despair.

                                     GANDHI
                         Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not 
                         ready yet. In South Africa the numbers 
                         were small...

                                     NEHRU
                         The Government's afraid, and they 
                         don't know what to do. But they're 
                         more afraid of terrorists than of 
                         you. The Viceroy has agreed to your 
                         release if you will speak for non-
                         violence.

                                     GANDHI
                              (a sad smile)
                         I've never spoken for anything else.

               THE STREETS OF AMRITSAR - EXTERIOR - DAY

               The golden dome of the Temple fills the screen, shimmering. 
               The sound of a car, and marching feet. The camera pulls back 
               from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees and then 
               suddenly, center of frame, the face of General Dyer -- blunt, 
               cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness. 
               He is traveling slowly, steadily in an armored car at the 
               head of fifty armed sepoys -- Gurkhas and Baluchis -- 
               immaculate, precise, awesome. Behind them a staff car with 
               Dyer's English ADC and a British police officer. It is a 
               relentless, determined procession, filling the dusty street 
               with a sense of menace and foreboding.

               JALLIANWALLAH BAGH - AMRITSAR - EXTERIOR - DAY

               A large public garden, enclosed by a thick, old, crumbling 
               wall. A large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform 
               at one side of the park. It is political, but the crowd is 
               mixed. We see Muslims and Hindus, many of them Sikhs, old 
               men, little children, women with babes in arms. Some donkey 
               carts, a sense of fair-time gaiety.

               We close in on the speaker -- a Muslim. He clutches a copy 
               (we need not see the title) of Gandhi's journal.

                                     SPEAKER
                         ...England is so powerful -- its 
                         army and its navy, all its modern 
                         weapons -- but when a great power 
                         like that strikes defenseless people 
                         it shows it brutality, its own 
                         weakness! Especially when those people 
                         do not strike back.
                              (He holds aloft the 
                              clenched journal.)
                         That is why the Mahatma begs us to 
                         take the course of non-violence!

               THE ENTRANCE OF THE JALLIANWALLAH BAGH - EXTERIOR - DAY

               General Dyer, his armored car, his sepoys, moving toward the 
               gate. Dyer looks ahead calmly.

               His point of view. The Gate of the Bagh. A rickety double 
               gate in the high crumbling wall. On each pillar, poster 
               notices for the meeting: "For Congress -- For Gandhi." In 
               the distance the speaker and the assembled crowd. Nearer, a 
               few vendors, loiterers and children. At the sound of the 
               armored car and marching feet, a few turn in curiosity.

               Another angle. The armored car grinds forward. It won't go 
               through the gates, one fender scraping against the gate post. 
               Dyer gives a quiet order, the car backs away. Dyer jumps 
               down lightly -- a man in splendid condition. He walks through 
               the gate and stands quietly in the at-ease position, hands 
               clasping his swagger stick behind his back. looking off at 
               The speaker -- medium shot.

                                     SPEAKER
                         ...If we riot, if we fight back, we 
                         become the vandals and they become 
                         the law! If we bear their blows, 
                         they are the vandals -- God and His 
                         law are on our...
                              (He glances up.)
                         side.

               Long shot -- his point of view. The two platoons of sepoys, 
               rifles at the port, trot smartly through the gate and fan 
               out on either side of the motionless and dominant figure of 
               Dyer.

               Resume the speaker.

                                     SPEAKER
                              (soldiering on)
                         ...We must have the courage to take 
                         their anger...

               Medium close -- the sepoys and Dyer. He issues his commands 
               in a quiet and unemotional voice, as though they were on 
               maneuvers.

                                     DYER
                         Port arms, Sergeant Major.

               The sergeant major issues the command. The troops port arms.

                                     DYER
                         Load.

               Again, the sergeant major barks the command, the bolts slam 
               back and forth, the magazines clatter.

               Featuring the platform and the front of the crowd. They have 
               all turned now to watch, frozen in incredulity and 
               fascination. The sound of the sergeant major's orders and 
               the sinister rattle of breeches and bolts drifting to them.

                                     SPEAKER
                              (almost to himself as 
                              he too is riveted)
                         ...Our pain will be our victory.

               Their point of view. The distant figures facing them.

               Resume the crowd. Numbly they begin to back away, pressing 
               against the speaker's stand, themselves. A man picks up a 
               child.

               Their point of view. The small, distant figures of the sepoys 
               again. A word of command. One platoon kneels and takes aim. 
               Another command. The second platoon, standing behind the 
               first, takes aim.

               Featuring Dyer. His ADC approaches. The British police officer 
               stands off to one side.

                                     ADC
                         Do we issue a warning, sir?

                                     DYER
                              (stiffly)
                         They've had their warning -- no 
                         meetings.

               It is final.

               Resume the crowd. A ripple of panic now, everyone pressing 
               back, but still they cannot credit what they see. Only one 
               or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek 
               shelter. It is too late.

               Close shot Dyer, still calm.

                                     DYER
                         Sergeant Major --

                                     SERGEANT MAJOR
                         Take aim!

               Long shot over the sepoys and their sights, the wavering 
               crowd distant.

                                     DYER
                         Fire!

               Flash shot along the line of sepoys; the rifles jerk and 
               bang. The crowd, running, screaming.

                                     SERGEANT MAJOR
                         Reload!

               A dreadful press of panic-stricken people flying toward the 
               walls. And again the crash of rifles. Some fall. Others run 
               off-screen in an aimless, irresistible wave.

               Dyer is walking behind his men, telling them, with a view to 
               maximum accuracy, what he has told them on the firing range 
               (it makes him a little irritable to have to repeat it).

                                     DYER
                         Take your time. Take your time.

               He looks off at the crowd. His eyes narrow.

               A group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top 
               of the wall, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, some 
               disappearing, a few heroic individuals astride the wall 
               reaching down to assist their women and children in the 
               swirling crowd below.

                                     DYER
                         Corporal!

                                     CORPORAL
                         Sir!

                                     DYER
                         Over there.

               He nods. The corporal looks.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Sir.

               He directs the attention of his neighbors in the firing line 
               toward the new target; they shift their aim.

               A man reaching for a child -- who is also propelled upward 
               by its mother from below -- is hit, falls, so that he and 
               the child crash into the crowd below.

               Sepoys firing ad lib. Dyer watching the effect, careful and 
               conscientious.

               Swift tracking a man running through the staggering crowd, 
               over the litter of bodies, his mouth open, his eyes wild. He 
               arrives at a well, throws down the rope and slides down it. 
               Others seize the idea and in panic throw themselves into the 
               well, dropping out of sight.

               Featuring Dyer. Meticulously, he taps a corporal on the 
               shoulder with his swagger stick and indicates the well. The 
               corporal signals his line of men.

               At the well. The gathering crowd -- men, women -- and laced 
               with rifle fire.

               From behind the sepoys we see the whole Bagh, littered with 
               dead and dying, a thick ruck around the well, the walls 
               hanging with wounded and dying, the firing continuing, loud, 
               loud, louder... until --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE ARMORY HALL - THE FORT OF LAHORE - INTERIOR - DAY

               Silence. The camera is close as it crosses a table with legal 
               documents. Gradually we hear a muffled cough, whispers, 
               shuffled papers, and it at last comes to a large close shot 
               of General Dyer.

               Another angle. A Commission of Inquiry sits in the large 
               Armory Hall of the Old Fort. Dyer faces a panel of 
               Commissioners: Lord Hunter, presiding, Mr. Justice Rankin, 
               General Barrow, a British civil servant, and an Indian 
               barrister.

               The Commission functions like a public parliamentary committee -- 
               little ceremony, no judicial robes, a small group of public 
               and press, who sit on wooden chairs behind a barrier that 
               isolates the Commission's business.

               Much of that public is English -- fellow officers and 
               civilians.

               A Government Advocate (English) turns to face Dyer.

                                     ADVOCATE
                         General Dyer, is it correct that you 
                         ordered your troops to fire at the 
                         thickest part of the crowd?

               Dyer glances woodenly at the panel -- a man in some shock at 
               the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of 
               praise.

                                     DYER
                              (righteously)
                         That is so.

               The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief -- more 
               at his attitude than his statement.

                                     ADVOCATE
                         One thousand five hundred and sixteen 
                         casualties with one thousand six 
                         hundred and fifty bullets.

               A slight reaction from the public section. Dyer's jaw 
               tightens.

                                     DYER
                         My intention was to inflict a lesson 
                         that would have an impact throughout 
                         all India.

               He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a 
               reasonable point. The evasiveness, the only half-buried 
               embarrassment of their response only deepens his own 
               withdrawal into himself.

                                     INDIAN BARRISTER
                         General, had you been able to take 
                         in the armored car, would you have 
                         opened fire with the machine gun?

               Dyer thinks about it. Then unashamedly --

                                     DYER
                         I think, probably -- yes.

               A muted reaction from the public section. The Indian barrister 
               stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his 
               notes.

                                     HUNTER
                         General, did you realize there were 
                         children -- and women -- in the crowd?

                                     DYER
                              (a beat)
                         I did.

               For the first time there is the hint of uncertainty in his 
               manner.

                                     ADVOCATE
                         But that was irrelevant to the point 
                         you were making?

                                     DYER
                         That is correct.

               There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among 
               the panel. Not so quickly in the public section.

                                     ADVOCATE
                         Could I ask you what provision you 
                         made for the wounded?

               Dyer looks at him quickly. The question is unexpected, even 
               a little "clever." The officers listening clearly resent it.

                                     DYER
                              (a moment, then firmly)
                         I was ready to help any who applied.

               And that answer stops the Advocate. He smiles dryly.

                                     ADVOCATE
                         General... how does a child shot 
                         with a 3-0-3 Enfield "apply" for 
                         help?

               Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in 
               his gut.

               JALLIANWALLAH BAGH - EXTERIOR - DAY

               Quiet: the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry. The camera 
               is panning slowly along a section of the wall. We are close 
               and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the 
               scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall 
               to claw a path to safety... And finally the camera comes to 
               a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have 
               just left. He is surveying the wall in the now empty park 
               numbly, desolately.

               Nehru stands a few feet away from him, his mood the same, 
               the same benumbed grief and incredulity.

               Resume the wall -- Gandhi's point of view. The camera 
               continues its pan -- bits of human hair matted in the dried 
               blood, and the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled 
               ground around it, little pieces of clothing. Flies buzz around 
               the debris. Abstractedly, Gandhi touches the bucket rope 
               that lies across the surround. Nehru has moved to the other 
               side of the well. Gandhi lifts his eyes to him...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               THE VICE-REGAL PALACE - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - DAY

               The imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India. 
               We establish then cut into

               GOVERNMENT COUNCIL ROOM - INTERIOR - DAY

               Featuring the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         You must understand, gentlemen, that 
                         His Majesty's Government -- and the 
                         British people -- repudiate both the 
                         massacre and the philosophy that 
                         prompted it.

               Chelmsford is pacing along one side of a large conference 
               table. Just in front of this is the "British" side -- two 
               generals (a full general and a brigadier), a naval officer, 
               two senior civil servants, a senior police officer. Across 
               from them is the "Indian" side: Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Jinnah, 
               Azad. This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the 
               full authority of a leader.

               The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsford's disclaimer -- 
               coolly, but accepting it. That lifts Chelmsford's hopes a 
               little.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         What I would like to do is to come 
                         to some compromise over the new civil 
                         legis --

                                     GANDHI
                         If you will excuse me, Your 
                         Excellency, it is our view that 
                         matters have gone beyond 
                         "legislation."

               It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry. 
               It stops Chelmsford in mid-pace.

                                     GANDHI
                         We think it is time you recognized 
                         that you are masters in someone else's 
                         home.
                              (It chills, stiffens; 
                              Gandhi proceeds only 
                              an iota softer)
                         Despite the best intentions of the 
                         best of you, you must, in the nature 
                         of things, humiliate us to control 
                         us. General Dyer is but an extreme 
                         example of the principle. It is time 
                         you left.

               The British are stunned almost to speechlessness -- the 
               audacity, the impossibility of it -- and from Gandhi of all 
               people. The senior civil servant, Kinnoch, is the first to 
               recover.

                                     KINNOCH
                         With respect, Mr. Gandhi, without 
                         British administration, this country 
                         would be reduced to chaos.

                                     GANDHI
                              (patient, ironic)
                         Mr. Kinnoch, I beg you to accept 
                         that there is no people on earth who 
                         would not prefer their own bad 
                         government to the "good" government 
                         of an alien power.

                                     BRIGADIER
                              (indignantly, choked)
                         My dear sir -- India is British! 
                         We're hardly an alien power!

               Gandhi and the others just look at him.

               Chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas 
               has been made, and he strives to get the meeting back on the 
               course he intends.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                         Even if His Majesty could waive all 
                         other considerations, he has a duty 
                         to the millions of his Muslim subjects 
                         who are a minority in this realm. 
                         And experience has taught that his 
                         troops and his administration are 
                         essential in order to keep the peace.

               He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both 
               Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this. Gandhi knows the trouble 
               this can cause and he answers more for those on his side 
               than the Viceroy's.

                                     GANDHI
                         All nations contain religious 
                         minorities. Like other countries, 
                         ours will have its problems.
                              (Flat, irrevocable)
                         But they will be ours -- not yours.

               Its finality is such that for a moment there is no response 
               at all, but then the General smiles.

                                     GENERAL
                         And how do you propose to make them 
                         yours? You don't think we're just 
                         going to walk out of India.

               His smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the others on 
               his side.

                                     GANDHI
                         Yes... in the end you will walk out. 
                         Because one hundred thousand 
                         Englishmen simply cannot control 
                         three hundred fifty million Indians 
                         if the Indians refuse to co-operate. 
                         And that is what we intend to achieve -- 
                         peaceful, non-violent, non-co-
                         operation.

               He looks at them all, then up at Lord Chelmsford behind them.

                                     GANDHI
                         Until you yourself see the wisdom of 
                         leaving... your Excellency.

               LATER - THE SAME GOVERNMENT COUNCIL ROOM

               Close shot -- a crystal decanter. The top is lifted, whiskey 
               pours.

               The camera pulls back. We are still in the Council Room, but 
               time has passed. The Indian delegation has gone, and the 
               British are relaxing as a servant pours.

                                     GENERAL
                              (mocking his exchange 
                              with Gandhi)
                         "You don't just expect us to walk 
                         out?" "Yes."

               And they all laugh.

                                     BRIGADIER
                         Extraordinary little man! "Nonviolent, 
                         non-co-operation" -- for a moment I 
                         almost thought they were actually 
                         going to do something.

               There are some smiles, but not all of them are quite so 
               amused.

                                     CHELMSFORD
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Yes -- but it would be wise to be 
                         very cautious for a time. The Anti-
                         Terrorist Act will remain on the 
                         statutes, but on no account is Gandhi 
                         to be arrested. Whatever mischief he 
                         causes, I have no intention of making 
                         a martyr of him.

               It is an instruction they all find correct.

               FIELD - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

               A roar of approval from a huge crowd. We are featuring two 
               British soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering 
               torch light that reveals their tense wariness.

               Another angle. And we can see its cause. A huge crowd is 
               gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- 
               and their mood is confident, belligerent. As their defiant 
               roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits 
               cross-legged on the platform. Nehru is with him. Patel, now 
               for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an 
               Indian tunic. Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with 
               them. But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who 
               has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd.

                                     BA
                              (simple, direct)
                         ...but now something worse is 
                         happening. When Gandhiji and I were 
                         growing up, women wove their own 
                         cloth. But now there are millions 
                         who have no work because those who 
                         can buy all they need from England. 
                         I say with Gandhiji, there is no 
                         beauty in the finest cloth if it 
                         makes hunger and unhappiness.

               It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and 
               turns away. There is applause and noise, but Ba does not 
               acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, 
               who is talking with Patel and Nehru. At last he rises, and 
               the noise and applause increase to something like chaos.

               In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the 
               perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary 
               by the enthusiasm of this greeting. Gandhi fiddles with his 
               glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd 
               and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but 
               quite definitely, the crowd stills.

                                     GANDHI
                         My message tonight is the message I 
                         have given to your brothers 
                         everywhere. To gain independence we 
                         must prove worthy of it.

               We intercut with the crowd, listening raptly. Gandhi holds 
               up one finger.

                                     GANDHI
                         There must be Hindu-Muslim unity -- 
                         always.
                              (A second finger.)
                         Secondly, no Indian must be treated 
                         as the English treat us so we must 
                         remove untouchability from our lives, 
                         and from our hearts.

               Neither of these goals is easy, and the audience reaction 
               shows it. Now Gandhi raises a third finger.

                                     GANDHI
                         Third -- we must defy the British.

               And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause. Gandhi lets 
               it run for a time, then stills it with the one small gesture 
               as before.

                                     GANDHI
                         Not with violence that will inflame 
                         their will, but with firmness that 
                         will open their eyes.

               This has sobered the audience somewhat. Now he looks out 
               across them as though seeking something. Then

                                     GANDHI
                         English factories make the cloth -- 
                         that makes our poverty.
                              (A reaction.)
                         All those who wish to make the English 
                         see, bring me the cloth from 
                         Ma
