     then falls out of FRAME -- (They're oblivious to this)

                      When confronted with the charge, which took
                      some figuring out for the officers on
                      the scene of the crime, Fay Barringer

                      was loaded.

                      sometimes a vistor and friend to Sydney
                      Barringer said that he had seen,

                                NARRATOR 
                      It seems that the arguing and the 
                      fighting and all of the violence was far 
                      too much for Sydney Barringer and knowing 
                      his mother and father's tendency to fight,
                      he decided to do something -- 

     CAMERA reveals that it is Sydney Barringer who is loading
     the shotgun. The YOUNG BOY is sitting nearby, watching Sydney
     mumble to himself as he loads shells into the shotgun.

                      each other, that all they wanted to
                      do was kill each other and he would 
                      help them if that's what they wanted to do --

     This is a WIDE ANGLE REPLAY of the whole event.  We see the whole

     A diagram is made to reflect the narration...this is done like NFL
     coverage where the x's and o's and arrows and lines are drawn to
     indicate placement and moves, etc.)

     An x appears on the top of the building over Sydney. 

                                NARRATOR 
                      Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop --
                      His parents argue three stories below -- 

     An o is marked to indicate their position. Image goes into MOTION
     with Sydney jumping...an ARROW is drawn that displays the PATH of
     his fall --

                      in the stomach as he passes the arguing
                      sixth floor window -- 

     Freeze Frame shows Sydney, hanging mid-air -- the glass shattering and
     starting to fall to the ground -- an X marks the spot where he is hit. 

                                NARRATOR 
                      He is killed instantly but continues 
                      to fall -- only to find, three stories
                      below -- a safety net installed 
                      three days prior for a set of window washers
                      that would have broken his fall and saved 
                      his life if not for the hole in his stomach.

     indicate the path -- UNFREEZE frame and watch Sydney fall into the net

                                NARRATOR 
                      So Fay Barringer was charged with the 
                      murder of her son and Sydney Barringer 
                      noted as an accomplice in his own death...

     CAMERA moves towards the little EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY as he watches 
     the older couple CRY and SCREAM as detectives begin to cuff them --

                      ...and it is in the humble opinion of this
                      narrator that this is not just "Something 
                      That Happened."  This cannot be "One of those
                      things..." This, please, cannot be that. 
                      And for what I would like to say, I can't.
                      This Was Not Just A Matter Of Chance. 

     CAMERA pushes in towards the MOTHER as she screams and screams and the
     officer's fight to regain control of her -- in the scuffle, the

                      You can't just come in here. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      The door was open, I got a call -- 

                                MARCIE
                      You're just come in -- 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Calm down.

                                MARCIE
                      I am calm. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I got a call to this apartment,
                      report of a disturbance -- 

                                MARCIE 
                      There's no disturbance. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I got a call of a disturbance, you're
                      door was open, I just wanna see
                      what's goin' on -- 

                                MARCIE 
                      There's no disturbance. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Then you've got nothin' to worry about.

                                MARCIE 
                      You don't tell me, I know my rights,
                      just come right in, you can't -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Don't test me, you wanna talk about 
                      what the law book says, we can do that,
                      push me far enough and I'll take you
                      to jail -- now calm down. 

                                MARCIE
                      I AM CALM. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You're not calm.  You're screamin'
                      and yellin' and I'm here to check 
                      on a disturbance that was reported
                      and that's what I'm gonna do - now
                      are you alone in here? 

                                MARCIE 
                      I don't have to answer your questions. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      No you don't: But I'm gonna ask 
                      you one more time: Are you alone in here? 

                                MARCIE 
                      What does it look like? 

                                JIM KURRING
                      No one else in here? 

                                MARCIE
                      You're here. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, 
                      besides me and besides you in this house? 

                                MARCIE
                      No.  I said that. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Are you lyin' to me? 

                                MARCIE
                      I live alone.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one 
                      more time: Is Anyone Else In This House
                      Right Now? 

                                MARCIE
                      No I Said. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Ok. What's your name? 

                                MARCIE
                      Marcie. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Ok. Marice why don't you take
                      a seat for me? 

                                MARCIE 
                      I preffer to stand. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I'm not askin', Marcie. 

     Marcie sits down. 

                                MARCIE 
                      I didn't do anything.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Maybe you didn't, but I'm here 
                      to find out about a disturbance.
                      Some neighbors called said they 
                      heard screaming and a loud crash.

                                MARCIE
                      I don't know a loud crash.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      And what about screaming? 

                                MARCIE 
                      I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just 
                      come in here and start pokin' around -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      What's this, how did this happen?

     INSERT, ECU. THE FLOOR.
     An ashtray has fallen on the floor, cigarette butts all around.

                                MARCIE 
                      An ashtray fell, I don't know, maybe
                      last night, I just woke up. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You just woke up.  And what'd you have
                      a party last night, the way this place
                      looks? 

                                MARCIE 
                      I went out last night. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you 
                      to have a new attitude with me.  The more 
                      you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna
                      become that you've been up to something.

                                MARCIE 
                      It's a free country, you can
                      think anything you want.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you
                      start givin' me some straight 
                      answers: I'm gonna assume that some
                      mischief has been goin' on here. 

                                MARCIE 
                      Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin'
                      about, mischief? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean.
                      Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been
                      doin' some drugs today? 

                                MARCIE
                      No. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You on any medication? 

                                MARCIE
                      No.

                                JIM KURRING
                      Been drinkin' today? 

                                MARCIE 
                      It's ten o'clock in the morning -- 

     There's a small THUMP noise OC. Jim turns his head quick and
     looks and Marcie freezes. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      --- What was that? 

                                MARCIE 
                      I didn't hear anything.

     Marcie stands up.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit 
                      back down on that couch -- 

                                MARCIE 
                      I don't have to do a god damn thing. 

     Kurring gets his handcuffs out and handcuffs her wrist to the
     couch, she goes crazy, screaming and yelling the whole time;

                                MARCIE 
                      WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN 
                      BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN 
                      and don't do this. I want you to stay -- 

     Continue with that until he's got her cuffed to the couch. 
     He removes his REVOLVER from his holster and starts to move
     slowly down the hall to the back bedroom -- 

                                MARCIE 
                      WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BULLSHIT? 
                      WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, MOTHERFUCKER?
                      MOTHER-GOD-DAMN FUCKER.  WHERE ARE YOU GOIN'?
                      DON'T GO IN MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM. 

     Kurring keeps moving slowly, gun drawn, CAMERA behind him;

                                JIM KURRING 
                      This is the LAPD. If anyone is 
                      back here I want you to come out
                      and I want you to show yourself 
                      to me with your hands in the air -- 

                                MARCIE 
                      THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT
                      OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.

     Kurring moves into the BEDROOM now and sees that the CLOSET is
     closed and probably the only place for someone to be hiding;

                                JIM KURRING 
                      This is the LAPD, if anyone is in
                      the closet I want you to come out 
                      and show yourself to me, slowly and
                      with your hands up -- 

                                MARCIE (OC) 
                      THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone
                      is in the closet, come out now -- 

                                MARCIE (OC) 
                      THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN 
                      CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM,
                      STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn
                      and If I Have To Open That Closet 
                      you will get shot -- Step Out Now. 

     Jim inches towards the closet, flips it open real quick and
     stands back, ready for something to jump out -- nothing. 

                                MARCIE 
                      I told you there was no one in there! 

     Jim looks down the hall at Marcie who has physically dragged
     the large couch handcuffed behind her; 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Marcie - Do not drag that couch any further! 

     JIM'S POV, CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CLOSET. 
     He pushes some sheets aside and burries around to reveal: 

     A DEAD SKINNY WHITE MAN (50s) curled up in a ball on the 
     floor of the closet.  He'd dead and he's been covered in dirty
     laundry.  He has a gag around his mouth.

     HOLD on Jim for a moment, he panics a little and swings his REVOLVER
     towards Marcie:

                                JIM KURRING 
                      What the hell is this Marcie? 

                                MARCIE
                      THAT'S NOT MINE. 

     Jim swings the aim of his gun back at the dead body.

                                                                CUT TO: 

     INT. EARL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Earl in bed, pretty out of it, but once in a while a couple clear
     moments.  Phil sits next to the bed, paper and coffee nearby. 

                                EARL 
                      ...n'I dowanna do this...sit here,

                      I reach out for it -- no -- 

     He mimes the action, gets nowhere near the pen. 

                                EARL 
                      ...no...no goddamn use.

                      I have a son, y'know? 

                                PHIL
                      You do? 

                                EARL
                      ...ah... 

                                PHIL
                      Where is he? 

                                EARL 
                      I don't know...I mean, he's around,
                      he's here, in town, y'know, but I 
                      don't know...he's a tough one...very....
                      Do you have a girlfriend, Phil? 

                                PHIL
                      No. 

                                EARL 
                      Get a girlfriend. 

                                PHIL
                      I'm trying. 

                                EARL 
                      And do good things with her...share 
                      the thing...all that bullshit is true,
                      y'know...find someone and hold on all
                      that...Where's Linda? 

                                PHIL 
                      She went out.  She said she went 
                      out to run some errands.  She'll be back. 

                                EARL 
                      She's a good girl.  She's a little

                      How come every word you say is either 
                      "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?" 

                                EARL

                      You got it. 

     EARL gets hit with something and starts to MOAN a bit.  Sharp
     pain hitting him and he touches his hand to his face....

                                EARL 
                      ...I can't hold onto this anymore...

                      I'll get you another pain pill.
                      Another morphine pill -- 

                                EARL

                      I wanna see this...where is he,
                      do you know? 

                                PHIL

                                PHIL
                      Is Jack your son?

     Earl doesn't answer.  He's drifting a bit more now.

                                PHIL 
                      You wanna call him on the phone?
                      We can call him, I can dial the 
                      phone if you can remember the number -- 

                                EARL 
                      -- it's not him. it's not him.
                      He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere... 

     Phil leans in closer to Earl. 

                                EARL 
                      This is so boring...so goddamn...
                      and dying wish and all that, old 
                      man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing: 

                                PHIL
                      It's ok. 

     Earl hallucinates a bit, cries a little, tries to form the sentences; 

                                EARL
                      ...find him on the...Frank. His name's
                      Frank Mackey -- 

                                PHIL 
                      Frank Mackey.  That's your son?

                      that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that,
                      give it -- 

     Earl tries to grab something near Phil's head that is not there.
     He's hallucinating more now, falls asleep a bit, mumbling; 

                                EARL 
                      ifyougimmethat....overonthe....fuck....
                      I can't hold ontothis anymore... 

     He gives Phil make an imaginary object and falls asleep.  BEAT. 
     Stay with Phil a moment as he turns his head, looking around the
     house a moment, looks back to Earl.

     INT. BURBANK HOLIDAY INN/BANQUET ROOM - THAT MOMENT

     FRANK steps into a CLOSE UP and holding a mic, says:

                                FRANK
                      Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys.

     REVERSE, THAT MOMENT. The crowd of fifty GUYS who are taking the 
     "Seduce and Destroy Seminar" that Frank is teaching today laugh and
     play along; 

     Frank is on a slightly elevated stage.  vBehind him a huge banner for,
     "Seduce and Destroy," whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf
     with a big buldge in his fur.  It reads: "No Pussy Has Nine Lives". 

                                FRANK 
                      And you did hear me right.  Tame it.
                      Take it on, head first -- with your 
                      skills at work and say, "No.  You will
                      not control me.  You will not take my
                      soul and you will not win this game."
                      'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna 
                      think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard
                      and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect 
                      the cock -- you are embedding this thought:
                      I'm in charge.  I'm the one who says yes, 
                      no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true.
                      Sad But True.  And you wanna know what?
                      It must be the way. 
                      The thing about chicks and the thing
                      about this course that we're going 
                      through today is how universal the whole 
                      thing is.  I mean: I wish I could sit here 
                      and say that it's not -- because the reality?
                      If each chick had something new, something
                      really new that I'd never seen before? 
                      Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money!  Because 
                      I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes,
                      a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars 
                      and hundred new videos just to deal with each
                      and every situation a chick could create - 
                      but that is just not the case.  They are universal.
                      They are sheep. They are to be studied and 
                      watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped,
                      interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin'
                      butt load if they were actually as much of 
                      a challenge as they want you to think they are!
                      Reality: They Are All The Same. 
                      Each and every one of them.  And once you learn 
                      these methods: You're Set.  You Don't Have To Come Back.
                      That's it. In solid. Boom.  Done.  Over.  Why?
                      Because all women are the same.  Period. 
                      End of discussion.  Sorry.  It's true.  Sad But True.
                      And anyone who wants to say that these methods
                      we work by are "unfair?"  Yes, they are.
                      Guilty as charged.  And so's the world. 
                      It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not 
                      gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie -- 
                      Period.  Sorry.  End of discussion.

                      store: Go And Get One.  Fuck it, if you
                      reach into your packet, you'll see I've
                      been nice enough to include one, 'cause
                      that's the kind of prick I am -- 
                      You're gonna need this calendar and I know
                      it sounds like a small thing, but having it
                      makes all the difference in the world:
                      If you meet a girl and you're 
                      gonna work an A-3 Interuption -- 
                      let's say an eight day waiting period before 
                      the next call -- how you gonna know when those
                      eight days are up?  Buy a calendar.
                      Next move?  Mark the calendar. 
                      Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did I pay my eight 
                      hundred dollars for?  To hear Frank tell me
                      to buy a calendar and mark it?  Just stick 
                      with me and stick by the calendar.  Mark it
                      up -- use it to set goals -- If you wanna 
                      make that "friend" something else -- you gotta
                      be hard on yourself, set goals:

                      "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay."
                      "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're
                      gonna be lickin' my spoon."
                      "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat
                      Sausage."  I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF.
                      And what?  I've said "enough is enough."
                      Because why?  She's not gonna be your pal.
                      She's not gonna be your friend.  You think
                      she's gonna be there for you the second
                      you need something?  Think again - this fuckin'
                      bitch Denise!
                                (audience cheers) 
                      But: Listen up:  That is not to say that we don't
                      all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna 
                      learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple
                      of chick-friends laying around can come in
                      real handy in setting Jealousy Traps. 
                      But we'll get to that.  Number One (this is page 18
                      in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and
                      follow along with me.)

     CAMERA DOLLIES AROUND a young GIRL (20s) on the phone. 

                                GIRL
                      That sounds like fun, Frank. 
                      I love seafood.

                      So I'll see you about 7:30? 
                      Great, then.  Bye-bye, Cindy. 

     He hangs up.

     INT. GIRL'S HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT
 
     CAMERA (HAND HELD) follows behind the GIRL as she walks from the kitchen
     to the front door, shaking her head, huffing and puffing....

                                FRANK (VO) 
                      You wait until about nine o'clock
                      and you ring the doorbell.

     She opens the door and sees FRANK, crying and hysterical. 

                                FRANK (VO) 
                      She opens it up, pissed as hell, but
                      finds you sobbing your eyes out -- 

     Frank looks up at her and says: 

                                FRANK
                      ...I can't believe what happened... 

     Frank and the Girl sit down on the couch together. 

                                FRANK (VO) 
                      You explain between sobs that you hit
                      a dog on the way over to pick her up
                      and you had to rush it to the animal 
                      hospital but by the time you got there -- 

                                FRANK 
                      ...and it's paw was sticking out... 
                      and it was too late.  It was too late. 

     She moves in and hugs him. 

                                GIRL 
                      Ohhh, shhhh...shhh...Frank...

     INT. HOLIDAY INN/BANQUET ROOM - THAT MOMENT

     Frank is cracking himself up.  He continues.

                                FRANK 
                      I can't believe I'm telling you guys this, 
                      but the truly terrifying part is that: THIS WORKS.
                      Any girl that calls herself your friend is not
                      gonna let you be alone in a situation like that.
                      Technique #2: Staging a fight. 
                      This is not knock down, drag out, crying
                      screaming, yelling -- this is a simple, 
                      direct and subtle way of planting confusion
                      into a girl's mind.  Remember we are using 
                      reinforcement technique "G" with these women.
                      Here's how:

                      Hello? 

                                GIRL 
                      Hey, Frank.  It's Cindy.  I'm wondering 
                      if you wanna grab a bite and see a movie? 

                                FRANK (VO) 
                      You very directly say:

                      "I don't think I have anything to say
                      to you, Cindy." 

     Frank hangs up the phone.

                      Let her wonder what she did wrong.

     CAMERA DOES A SLOW DOLLY IN.  Frank's tone changes a bit, gets darker:

                                FRANK
                      This is the way...because they will
                      always wonder, "What did I do?" 
                      "What could I have done different?" 
                      "How should I behave to get this back?"
                      And if they think that way -- then they
                      are asking for you to hurt them and 
                      That Is What You Must Do.  That is what
                      you must do which is punish them many,
                      many times over.

     Quick shots get them in the room:  DR. LANDON (40s) sits
     across from LINDA, who's in semi-hysterics, pacing; 

                                LINDA 
                      -- he's fucking dying, he's dying
                      as we're sitting here and there
                      isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, 
                      how can you tell me to calm down? 

                                DR. LANDON 
                      I can help you through this the 
                      best I know how but there are certain
                      things you are gonna have to be 
                      strong about and take care of, now
                      we can go over them, but I need to 
                      know that you're listening to me, ok? 

                                LINDA 
                      I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just
                      in a fucking state, I know he's 
                      going and it's like I don't know how
                      -- just tell me practical things -- 
                      What the fuck do I do with his body? 
                      What happens when he dies? That next moment:
                      What? What do I do?  Then What? 

                                DR. LANDON 
                      Well that's what Hospice will take care of
                      for you.  They will send a nurse, someone 
                      who can take care of all of that for you -- 

                                LINDA 
                      He has Phil right now.

                                DR. LANDON 
                      Phil's one of the nurses from the service? 

                                LINDA 
                      Yeah.

                                DR. LANDON 
                      If you're happy with Phil taking care
                      of him and helping you, that's fine, 
                      but contact Hospice to arrange for the body -- 

                                LINDA 
                      -- you don't understand: it's more pain 
                      than before and the fucking morphine pills
                      aren't working, he's -- past two days it's 
                      like he can't really swallow them and I don't 
                      know if they're going down -- I can't see inside
                      his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring
                      at him and I don't think the pills are going
                      down and he moans and he hurts -- 

                                DR. LANDON 
                      We can fix that, because I can give
                      you -- are you listening? 

                                LINDA 
                      I'm listening.  I'm getting better. 

                                DR. LANDON 
                      Do you wanna sit down? 

                                LINDA 
                      I need to sit down.

                                DR. LANDON 
                      Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it.
                      He's dying. He is.  He is dying very,
                      very rapidly -- 

     She breaks a bit more.

                                DR. LANDON 
                      Now the thing here is making that experience 
                      as painless and easy as possible for him, 
                      you understand?  Now you need to get in touch 
                      with Hospice care because they can take care of
                      all those practical things that you're asking 
                      me about -- they are who you call when he dies. 

     He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;

                                DR. LANDON 
                      This is the number for Hospice.
                      Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go,
                      there is something else to consider that
                      can take the pain away that he is in,
                      there is a very strong and very potent solution
                      of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,
                      with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in
                      his mouth and drop on his tounge and 
                      it will certainly diminish the pain that
                      he is in but you have to realize that
                      once you give it to him; there really 
                      is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly
                      cure his pain, but he will float in and 
                      out of consciousness, even worse than he
                      is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the 
                      recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- 

                                LINDA 
                      -- how the fuck can I say anything 
                      to that -- I don't know what to say to that -- 

                                DR. LANDON 
                      The job here is to make him as comfortable 
                      as possible -- right now -- our job is to just
                      try and make it as painless as possible.
                      Right?  You understand?

                      Hello.  Is Claudia here? 

                                MIDDLE AGED GUY
                      She's asleep. 

     BEAT. 

                                JIMMY 
                      Are you her boyfriend? 

                                MIDDLE AGED GUY 
                      You're Jimmy Gator, right? 

                                JIMMY 
                      Yes.  What's your name? 

                                MIDDLE AGED GUY
                      I'm Bob. 

                                JIMMY 
                      You're her boyfriend? 

                                MIDDLE AGED GUY 
                      No, I'm just a friend.  What are you 
                      doing here, I mean...you know Claudia? 

                                JIMMY
                      I'm her father. 

     The Middle Aged Guy looks a bit confused. 

                                JIMMY
                      Can I come in?

                                MIDDLE AGED GUY
                      Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean -- 

     Jimmy steps inside, looks around the place, sees the coke and some pot
     and pills sitting out on the coffee table. 

                                MIDDLE AGED GUY
                      Want me to wake her up? 

                                JIMMY 
                      I'II go....is it...back here? 

     The Middle Aged Guy points Jimmy to the back bedroom. 

     INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

     Claudia is asleep. Jimmy enters, stands near the edge of the bed.
     After a moment, Claudia's eyes open, look over and see Jimmy.

                                CLAUDIA
                      ...what the fuck is this...? 

                                JIMMY 
                      It's me.  Claudia.  It's me. 

     She sits up a bit, covers herself, looks past him and sees the
     Middle Aged Guy, sitting in his underwear in the living room,
     watching them.  She looks back to Jimmy; 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      What do you want? Why are you here? 

                                JIMMY
                      I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend
                      let me in, I just knocked on the door -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      He's not my boyfriend.

     Jimmy hesitates a beat, then:

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Wanna call me a slut now, something?

                                JIMMY
                      No.  No. 

     She starts to move towards tears, nervousness;

                                CLAUDIA 
                      What the fuck do you want?

                                JIMMY 
                      I want to sit.  I want to talk to you. 

                                CLAUDIA
                      Don't sit down. 

                                JIMMY 
                      ...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia.
                      Maybe we can just talk to straighten
                      our things out....there are so many
                      things that I want to tell you -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I don't wanna talk to you.

                                JIMMY 
                      Please.  It doesn't have to be now. 
                      Maybe we can make a date to sit down, 
                      I didn't mean to walk in on you like this -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Why are you here, why are you doing this?
                      Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore? 

                                JIMMY 
                      I don't want you to think that I'm that
                      way to you -- I'm not gonna call you
                      a slut or something -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are 
                      doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE? 

                                JIMMY 
                      Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy. 

                                JIMMY 
                      I'm not saying that, I'm sorry -- 

                                CLAUDIA
                      I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're
                      the one who's wrong.  You're the one -- 

                                JIMMY 
                      I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia.
                      I'm sick. 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Get out of here, get the fuck out of
                      my house -- 

                                JIMMY 
                      Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now.
                      I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell
                      down and I'm Not...DON'T -- 

                                CLAUDIA
                      GET THE FUCK OUT. 

                                JIMMY 
                      I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer.
                      I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. 
                      It's metastasized in my bones and I -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT. 

                                JIMMY 
                      I'm not lying to you, I'm not -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

                                JIMMY
                      baby, please, please -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL.
                      I'm not your fuckin' baby -- 

     She moves up in the bed, exposes a bit of her breast, tries to
     cover herself --

                                JIMMY 
                      Please put your clothes on, please -- 

                                CLAUDIA
                      YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell 
                      and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.

                                JIMMY
                      Honey. 

                                CLAUDIA
                      GET OUT. 

     BEAT.  He stands a moment. 

                                JIMMY 
                      Your mother wants to hear from you -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

     He walks out of the bedroom, past the MIDDLE AGED GUY, who's
     sitting on the couch. 

                                JIMMY
                      I'm sorry. 

                                MIDDLE AGED GUY
                      It's alright. 

     Jimmy exits.  Claudia is shaking and crying and holding herself
     in the covers of the bed. 

     The Middle Aged Guy snorts a line of coke, looks into her; 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Can you get your shit and leave, please? 

                                                                CUT TO: 

     INT. SOLOMON AND SOLOMON ELECTRONICS - DAY

     CAMERA pushes in as Donnie Smith runs in the door, brushes his
     hair back, etc.  This is a "Good Guys" type electronics place.
     He rushes towards the back.

     ANGLE, DOOR TO BACK ROOM.
     CAMERA pushes in real quick and tilts down as Donnie reaches
     to his belt and his KEY HOLDER (one of those attached to string
     on the belt) He inserts the KEY. 

                                                                CUT TO: 

     INT. BACK HALLWAY - SOLOMON AND SOLOMON - THAT MOMENT

     Donnie enters, walks swiftly down the hall to another door.
     Just before he reaches it, AVI SOLOMON (30s) appears at the
     end of the hall. 

                                AVI
                      Don. 

     Donnie stops short, looks.  Avi gives him the "follow me" finger. 

                                DON 
                      Hey, Avi.  I'll be right there.

     Avi goes back in the room he came from.  Donnie does the
     KEY and CODE thing now on this door.

                                                                CUT TO: 

     INT. DRESSING ROOM/EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

     Donnie is changed into his Solomon and Solomon Electronics vest
     and name tag.  He brushes himself up, sweating a bit. (Note:ON HIS BACK) 

                                DONNIE 
                      This is going to be ok. This is. This is.

                                                                CUT TO:

     INT. SOLOMON'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

     Donnie sitting across the desk from SOLOMON SOLOMON (40s) owner
     of the store. Avi, his brother, stands nearby. 

                                DONNIE
                      ...please... 

                                SOLOMON 
                      Don't Donnie. Don't do it. 

     Donnie swells up a bit, about to cry. 

                                DONNIE 
                      This is so fucked, Solomon.
                      I don't deserve this. 

                                SOLOMON 
                      Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making
                      sense, this making a lot of sense.
                      You are not doing the job, the job
                      I ask you to do, a job I give you. 
                      Over and over and over and I'm sorry.
                      But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that
                      much more.

                                DONNIE 
                      Solomon: I am in the middle of so much.
                      So much in my life and this is -- 
                      If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked.
                      I can't really explain much, but please,
                      please, I've worked here for four years,
                      four years I've given you and I'm, I'm,
                      I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late. 
                      I had a car accident.  I accidentaly 
                      drove into a seven-eleven. It was not
                      my fault. 

                                AVI
                      Who's fault was it, Don? 

                                SOLOMON 
                      Avi, please, shut the fuck up for
                      one second. Don, how much further 
                      do you want me to go in showing you,
                      showing you what I've done for you
                      in four years and what you've done 
                      back?  Do you want me to do it? I can. 
                      The loans I've given, how much your sales 
                      are, how late you are, over and over, loosing
                      the keys to the Covina store --

                                SOLOMON 
                      -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck.
                      Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give.
                      When I find you, when I meet you,
                      what? I put you on the billboard, 
                      I put you in the store, my salesman,

                      a chance and over and over, over you 
                      let me down.  I trust you with so much. 
                      The keys to my store, the codes to my locks,
                      the life, the blood of my bussiness and

                      here if you do this.  This is the worst timing.

     He struggles with his KEY CHAIN and finally after a bunch

     INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX/NORTH HOLLYWOOD - THAT MOMENT

     CAMERA hangs inside bedroom w/Detectives and Investigators and 
     County Coroner folks as we go through in a series of quick shots.
     (Director's Note: very technical here. Snapshots, ECU's on body,
     procedure, etc.) * See County Coroner videotape. 

     IN THE LIVING ROOM

     CAMERA pushes in past DETECTIVES and OFFICERS who are exchanging
     information...CAMERA moves towards Jim Kurring, standing off a bit 
     now, usless to the investigation as far as everyone else is concerned,
     but listening carefully to what they say: 

                                OFFICER
                      Identified as Porter Parker, aged 59.
                      Better known as the dead guy in the closet.
                      So says the building guy, this is her
                      husband -- 

                                DETECTIVE #2
                      -- he's doesn't live here, but he comes
                      around, raises shit, screaming, yelling,
                      something or other --

                                OFFICER
                      There's a son, apparently.  And a kid.

                                DETECTIVE #1
                      Her son?
 
                                OFFICER
                      Her son, that's right...and the kid.
                      And they were here and around and
                      from late last night and through the
                      morning, it's screaming and yelling --

                                DETECTIVE #1
                      And Where Are They?

                                DETECTIVE
                      -- they are not to be found.

                                CORONER WOMAN
                      -- she's got six hundred dollars and
                      a large box of condoms next to the bed --

                                OFFICER #1
                      And three wedding rings.

                                DETECTIVE #1
                      Ok.

                                CORONER WOMAN 
                      -- guys come in, out and around all day,
                      this is the building guy talking --

                                OFFICER 
                      The building guy says The Son and The
                      Closet guy are always goin' at it --

                                CORONER WOMAN
                      That's right. 

                                DETECTIVE #1 
                      And what is she saying? 

                                OFFICER 
                      Not a god damn thing.

     CAMERA lands CU on Jim Kurring.

     ANGLE, COURTYARD AREA - THAT MOMENT
     Another set of Detectives/Officers/Investigators are standing
     over Marcie, who sits handcuffed.  She has her best, "I'm not
     saying anything" face on.  Again, they're OC througout;

                                OFFICER #2
                      Why did you kill him, Marcie?

                                DETECTIVE #3
                      Did you kill him? 

                                OFFICER #2 
                      Did he hurt you, did he do something? 

                                DETECTIVE #4
                      How long's he been in there?

                                DETECTIVE #3
                      You're hurting yourself, Marcie. 

                                OFFICER #3 
                      You have the dead body of your husband 
                      in the closet of your apartment, Marcie. 

                                OFFICER #2
                      That Is Not Good. 

                                DETECTIVE #3 
                      You hit him with the ashtray,
                      you strangled him --

                                DETECTIVE #4 
                      -- tell us he fell and hit his head,
                      but tell us something, Marcie. 

                                OFFICER #2 
                      Why did you kill him? 

     The Main Detective from previous steps into FRAME, says:

                                DETECTIVE #1 
                      -- Marcie: Where's your son?  Marcie? 
                      Marcie?  Marcie tell us where your Son is now.
                      Marcie tell us where your son is. 

     CAMERA arrives CU on Marcie. 

                                MARCIE 
                      I wanna talk to my motherfuckin' lawyer.

     ANGLE, STREET OUTSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER
     The investigation is wrapping up now and CAMERA (STEADICAM)
     moves with Jim Kurring as he heads towards his squad car, 
     talking into his WALKIE TALKIE. (Dir. Note: technical info re:
     disturbance at adress/Jim takes call/etc.)

                                WALKIE VOICE
                      ...4277 Tujunga...

                                JIM KURRING
                      10-4.

     Out of the group of neighborhood lookie-lo's comes a little black
     kid who starts walking alongside Jim Kurring as they head away 
     from the scene -- this is DIXON, age 10.  He's very small for his age
     and he carries one of those boxes filled with Candy Bars he's trying
     to sell.  They walk/talk;

                                DIXON 
                      How much you pay me for my help? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I think it's more complicated
                      than that little man. 

                                DIXON 
                      Put me on the payroll, find out,
                      find out wassup -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You don't just sign up to be a police
                      officer -- it's about three years of
                      training -- ok?

                                DIXON 
                      I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna
                      buy some candy to help underprivelaged
                      youth in the -- 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Sorry, little man. 

                                DIXON 
                      You wanna take my statement, I'll 
                      perform for you, gotta get paid though,
                      gotta get PAID. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Why the hell aren't you in school?

                                DIXON 
                      No school today.  My teacher got sick. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      They don't have substitute teachers
                      where you go to school?

                                DIXON 
                      Nope.  So what'd they find out in there? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      That's confidential information, little man. 

                                DIXON 
                      Tell me what you know, I'll tell you 
                      what I know --

                                JIM KURRING
                      No Can Do.

                                DIXON 
                      Leave this one to the detectives, 
                      they ain't gonna solve shit, I can 
                      help you, make you the man with a plan,
                      give you the gift that I flow -- think 
                      fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy? 

     Jim Kurring stops at his Squad Car, turns to Dixon; 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Ok. Listen. You: c'mere. 

                                DIXON
                      No. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You wanna disrespect an officer of the law? 

                                DIXON 
                      I can help you solve the case,
                      I can tell you who did it. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes? 

                                DIXON
                      I'm a rapper. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a
                      record contract?

                                DIXON 
                      Not yet -- "give you the clue for 
                      the bust if you show me some trust --"

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall? 

                                DIXON
                      I ain't fuckin with you -- 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it. 

                                DIXON 
                      C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Go. Hurry up. Let's go. 

     Dixon places his box of candy down and starts dancing around.
     Jim Kurring stands beside his squad car.

                      -- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't
                      need to hear that word -- 

                                DIXON 
                      -- livin' to get older

                      Alright, alright, cut it, coolio.
                      That's enough with the mouth and
                      the language.

                                DIXON
                      I'm almost done. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Finish it up without the lip. 

                                DIXON 
                      Check that ego - come off it -

                      When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord

     HOLD ON KURRING.

                                DIXON
                      Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.

                                JIM KURRING
                      Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's
                      real helpful Ice-T.

     Kurring gets behind the wheel, Dixon hustles over;

                                DIXON
                      Did you listen to me?

                                JIM KURRING
                      I was listening --

                                DIXON
                      -- I told you who did it and you're not
                      listening to me.

                                JIM KURRING
                      -- and I'm through playin' games.

     Kurring closes his door and drives off...(Director's Note: Reference

                                                                CUT TO:

     CAMERA PUSHES IN SLOW on STANLEY as he sits at a desk...piles of
     books spread out in front of him....

     OVERHEAD ANGLE, LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN ONTO:
     All the books he has in front of him, we catch glimpses of things:

     "How Things Work"  "Forensic Studies" "The Guiness Book of World 
     Records"  "The Natural History of Nonsense"  "Weather"  "Learned Pigs..." 

     INSERT, CU. IMAGES of the book about weather.  CAMERA scans, dissolves
     and moves around various images of ancient BAROMETERS, HYGROMETERS
     from the 1700's.  We see 16th Century French comic strips regarding
     weather as cartoon characters.  Aristotle pointing to the sky. 
     Scan past the words, "...our quest to understand and predict the
     weather reaches back to the Stone Age..."

     CU - Stanley's face as he reads. SLOW ZOOM IN.
     CU - School Bell RINGS.
     CU - He grabs his books.

                      C'mon, man. 

                                STANLEY 
                      You're late, not me. 

                                RICK 
                      You coulda been in front -- 

                                STANLEY 
                      -- I didn't see you from the window. 

     Rick helps him get the bags in the car.  CAMERA stays real TIGHT 
     following STANLEY'S FACE....he sits in the car....OC we hear Rick 
     getting in the driver's seat and starting the enqine...little droplets 
     of RAIN start to fall on the windshield....

                                RICK (OC)
                      You ready to keep winning? 

                                STANLEY
                      Sure. 

     STANLEY is driven away, OUT OF FRAME.

     CAMERA (STEADICAM) follows behind Stanley and Rick as they run
     in from the rain, through some sliding glass doors, past a SECURITY
     GAURD who buzzes them into another set of doors -- 

     They enter a hallway with a bunch of production offices, walking
     swiftly, shaking their wet clothes....the contestant coordinator
     comes walking towards them: CYNTHIA (30s)

                                CYNTHIA
                      There you are, there you are.

                                RICK
                      Sorry we're late, Cynthia. 

                                CYNTHIA 
                      Nothin' to it, no problem.
                      How you doin' Stanley? 

                                STANLEY 
                      I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine. 

                                CYNTHIA 
                      Ready to go,go,go?

                                STANLEY 
                      Where's Richard and Julia?

                      They're here, they're fine.
                      In the dressing room.
                                (to Rick)
                      See you later -- 

     Rick gives Stanley a pat on the head; 

                                RICK 
                      Go to it, handsome. 

                                STANLEY 
                      See you.

     CAMERA holds with Rick, does a 180 around him, he turns his
     back to us now, walks a bit, enters a door, into -- 

     THE PARENTS GREEN ROOM

     Rick greets the other two kids parents: RICHARD'S MOM (overhweiqht, 50s)
     and RICHARD DAD (same) JULIA'S DAD and JULIA'S MOM (50s) 

                                RICK 
                      Who's ready to beat the record? 

                                RICHARD'S MOM
                      Jesus you scared us! 

                                JULIA'S DAD
                      That was close. 

                                RICK

     CAMERA picks up with a young PRODUCTION KID who drops some coffee 
     off for JULIA'S MOM...follow him back out into the hallway -- CAMERA
     branches off from him -- moves down another corridor and picks back
     up with STANLEY and CYNTHIA as they walk and talk; 

                                STANLEY 
                      Where's the news department at this studio? 

                                CYNTHIA
                      It's upstairs. 

                                STANLEY 
                      Have you ever been there? 

                                CYNTHIA
                      Sure, why? 

                                STANLEY 
                      I'm wondering about the weather 
                      department. I'm wonderin' wether 
                      or not the weather people use outside
                      meteorlogical services or if they
                      have in-house instruments?

                                CYNTHIA 
                      I can check on that for you, maybe
                      we can take a tour --

                                STANLEY
                      Ok. 

     They pass CAMERA which picks up now with a woman MARY (40s)
     This is Jimmy Gator's assistant...she walks to his dressing
     room door and knocks --

                      Come in. 

     Mary enters the room.  Jimmy is getting dressed in his outfit
     for the show* and starting to take shots of Jack Daniel's.

                      Fifteen minutes ago, where were
                      those cards? 

                                MARY
                      I'm sorry. 

                                JIMMY 
                      I need you to get me Paula -- 

                                MARY 
                      You want her right now? 

                                JIMMY 
                      Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere
                      in the building -- 

                                MARY 
                      We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy. 

                                JIMMY 
                      Find her, get her and tell her I want
                      to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.

     things up in her arms --

     EXT. MEDICAL BUILDING/SHERMAN OAKS - THAT MOMENT

     CAMERA pushes in on LINDA'S MERCEDES as it pulls into a parking 
     structure.  The RAIN is pouring down.  She steps out of the car -- 

                                                                CUT TO: 

     INT. MEDICAL BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

     CAMERA pulls back as Linda exits some elevators, heads down a hall --

     INT. OFFICE/WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     She enters a psychologist's waiting room. Three or four chairs
     and a LIGHT SWITCH that has a doctors name next to it.

     ECU - She flips the switch and a red light goes on.

     INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

     A small, comfortable office space.  Linda is crying, talking,
     pacing.  The psychologist is a middle aged woman, DR. DIANE.
     As they talk, Dr. Diane writes a perscription;

                                LINDA 
                      I hate doing this, coming here
                      and not being able to talk -- 

                                DR. DIANE 
                      I understand, it's fine -- 
                      I wish the circumstance was better. 

                                LINDA 
                      I don't know what's gonna happen,
                      I really don't -- I'm so fucking, 
                      I feel so over the top with everything. 

                                DR. DIANE 
                      Mmm..Hmm.  Running out of your 
                      medication at all, let alone at 
                      a time like this could be drastic,
                      I'm glad you came in to see me,
                      as short as this has been -- 

     She hands over the perscriptions (x2) and is about to say another
     word -- but Linda SNATCHES the two small pieces of paper from
     her hand and heads for the door -- 

                                LINDA 
                      Thank you Doctor Diane --

     CAMERA holds on PHIL.  SLOW ZOOM IN as he stands in front of
     the television, flipping stations.

     ANGLE, THE TELEVISION. 
     It's plays all sorts of various things.  Phil stops a few beats
     on each thing that looks vaguely like an infomercial. 

     He puts the remote down, exits the room.  CAMERA stays a moment,
     catches a glimpse of a promo for, "What Do Kids Know?"

     It's VARIOUS IMAGES of Stanley and the other kids answering 
     questions, with a calendar showing they've been at it for over

     CAMERA pulls back from Frank, who heads offstage.  The AUDIENCE is 
     applauding him.  The sidekick, DOC takes the mic and makes an
     announcement about the one hour break/snacks served in lobby/etc.

     Frank hops offstage, greets Captain Muffy and Gwenovier;

                      Chief, this is Gwenovier from the show,
                      "Profiles," for the interview --

                      Hello, hello, I'm a bit out of breath
                      from all this work --

                      That's fine.  It's nice to meet you. 

                                FRANK 
                      Are we gonna tape some stuff now? 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      If you're up to it, I've got us
                      set up in a suite upstairs --

                      You got us a room so quick? 

     Frank and Captain Muffy laugh at the joke.

                                FRANK 
                      I'm kidding of course.

     INT. HOTEL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

     Frank is getting his mic put on, Gwenovier has a small VIDEO CREW
     with her.  They both get touched up for the interview, Frank's
     talking away; 

                                FRANK 
                      I swear to fucking-god, I do one-a-my
                      seminars, I'm Superaman! I'm Batman! 
                      I'm like a fucking action hero the way 
                      I feel afterwards, like I could walk out 
                      this door, down the street, pick up any fuckin'
                      pootie I see that has even one second to stop -- 

     Gwenovier gives a little snap and finger gesture to her CAMERAMAN
     to start rolling;

                      Just one look, one hesitation, 
                      one subtle gesture for me to know --
                      And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a 
                      tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped 
                      at these seminars and lemme tell you
                      why: Because I Am What I Believe.
                      I am what I teach, I do as I say, 
                      I live by these rules as religiously
                      as I preach them: And you wanna know 
                      what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right,
                      up, down, center and sideways. 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      I'm gonna start rolling --

                      -- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here.
                      And I'II tell you samethin' else: 
                      I'm not succeding in the bush because
                      I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, 
                      there are women out there that want 
                      to destroy me -- it makes it twice as
                      hard for me, I run into some little 
                      muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes
                      and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna 
                      fuck around, prove to her friends, say,
                      "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he 
                      wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me?
                      I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole 
                      fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and
                      right from terrorist blonde beauties.
                      But I'II tell you this: The battle of 
                      the bush is being fought and won by Team
                      Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette? 

                                GWENOVIER
                      Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple
                      questions to start --

     Captain Muffy hands Frank a cigarette, lights it for him.

     VIDEO CAMERA'S POV - It's zooms in to close up of Frank.  He exhales;

                                FRANK 
                      What do you want to know?

     EXT. SMILING PEANUT BAR - THAT MOMENT

     CAMERA BOOMS DOWN and PUSHES IN on Donnie Smith's Honda Accord,
     with damaged front end, as it pulls into a parking space.
     It's POURING RAIN. (dir.note) 

     CAMERA lands in close.  Donnie sits a moment.  He plays his tape,
     "Dreams," sings along a bit, pep talks himself, does some deep 
     breathing, says; 

                                DONNIE 
                      Make it happen, make it happen and go,go,go. 

     He gets out of the car real quick -- 

                                                                CUT TO: 

     INT. SMILING PEANUT BAR - THAT MOMENT

     CAMERA (STEADICAM) pushes in as Donnie enters this dark little bar.
     It's not too crowded.  He takes off his wet coat, brushes his hair 
     back a bit and walks to an empty corner table --

     Donnie takes his seat and looks over to the bar -- CAMERA swings a 180,
     heads away from him -- it moves to the bar area and into:

     A young, handsome BARTENDER BRAD (20s) is pouring drinks.

     CAMERA picks up with a COCKTAIL WAITRESS (30s) who walks over and 
     brings us back to Donnie's booth -- 

                                COCKTAIL WAITRESS 
                      Hello.  You're back again, huh? 

                                DONNIE 
                      yeah, yes, hi, hello. 

                                COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                      -- can I get you? 

                                DONNIE
                      Diet Coke. 

     She exits.  Donnie lights a cigarette -- CAMERA blends from 24fps 
     to 40fps -- he looks across the room -- CAMERA swings 180 back towards
     the bar and pushes in towards -- 

     Bartender Brad takes the order from the Cocktail Waitress. 
     He nods, turns from her and smiles to reveal a full set of BRACES. 

     ANGLE, DONNIE.  CAMERA pushes in slow and he smiles, touches his
     hand to his mouth.

     DONNIE'S POV - The Bartender pours the coke, turns his attention towards
     an old-freaky looking Thurston Howell/Truman Capote/Dorothy Parker 
     type guy (60s) at the end of the bar, who raises his glass, motions as
     if to say, "Another one of these, please," while waving some money
     and smiling/flirting with Brad the Bartender. 

     Donnie's face drops.  CAMERA DOLLIES back a little bit and blends from
     40fps to 24fps.  The Cocktail Waitress arrives back; 

                                COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                      Diet Coke. 

                                DONNIE 
                      I want a shot of tequila too.

                                COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                      -- what kind? 

                                DONNIE 
                      It doesn't matter. 

     Donnie GLARES across the bar at BRAD and THURSTON as they flirt.

     INT. TELEVISION STUDIO/HALLWAYS - THAT MOMENT

     CAMERA leads/follows the kids from the show; STANLEY, RICHARD
     (overweight, 12) and JULIA (child-star-type 11).  They're led by
     CYNTHIA, down the corridors towards the main set --

                                JULIA 
                      Do you still have to do homework? 

                                RICHARD 
                      Not as much as I used to.  Ever since
                      we started, I haven't really gone in to 
                      school that much because I've been getting
                      more and more auditions -- 

                                STANLEY 
                      I don't have regular classes anymore. 

                                RICHARD
                      What do you do? 

                                STANLEY 
                      They just let me have my own study-time,
                      my own reading time in the library. 

                                RICHARD 
                      That's pretty cool. 

                                JULIA 
                      Do you have an agent, Stanley? 

                                STANLEY
                      No. 

                                JULIA 
                      You should get one, I'm serious, 
                      you could get a lot of stuff out of this -- 

                                STANLEY
                      Like what? 

                                RICHARD 
                      What do you mean, "like what?" 
                      -- you could get endorsments and shit -- 

                                CYNTHIA
                      -- Richard. 

                                RICHARD 
                      Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free 
                      things from people that want you to
                      endorse their products.

                                JULIA
                      Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something. 

                                STANLEY
                      What's MOW? 

                                JULIA
                      Movie Of The Week.  I went up for
                      one this morning with Alan Thicke 
                      and Corey Haim --

                                RICHARD
                      Was it a call back?

                                JULIA
                      No.  But I probably will get a call back.

                                RICHARD 
                      If we beat the record, you might get
                      a call back -- 

                                JULIA 
                      I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard. 

                                RICHARD
                      Saucy-saucy. 

                                CYNTHIA
                      C'mon guys, settle down -- 

                                STANLEY
                      Cynthia? 

                                CYNTHIA
                      What? 

                                STANLEY 
                      How much time do we have? 

                                CYNTHIA 
                      Not enough, what do you want? 

                                STANLEY 
                      I should maybe go to the bathroom. 

                                CYNTHIA
                      Can you hold it? 

                                STANLEY
                      I don't know. 

                                CYNTHIA
                      Just hold it, you'll be fine. 

     They arrive and enter onto the stage -- CAMERA swings around, branches
     away from them and BOOMS UP to reveal the set; 

     There is a LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE that's being settled into their seats.

     It's a three-camera set up with a FLOOR DIRECTOR roaming around,
     shouting orders, etc.

     There's a spot for the announcer, an old-pro named DICK JENNINGS (60s)
     Dick is in the middle of doing bad-comedy warm up for the studio
     audience.  He's had a few drinks, etc. 

     The STAGE itself is a cross between JEAPORDY/NEWLEYWED GAME/PRICE IS
     RIGHT.  There's a podium for Jimmy Gator.  One panel holds "The Kids,"
     and one panel holds, "The Adults."  There are chaser-lights all around
     and some of the design feels left over from the early days of the show.

     CAMERA hangs out with the KIDS as they are ushered into their panel,
     which at this moment faces away from the audience and is behind a
     curtain.  Julia turns her head, sees something:

                                JULIA 
                      Here they come -- 

     The ADULT CHALLENGERS are brought out by an assistant type and loaded
     into their panel.  The Adult Challengers are:

     Black woman named MIM MacNEAL(40s) 
     White guy with glasses TODD GERONIMO (20s)
     Puerto Rican guy named LUIS GUZMAN (40s) 

     The Adults give a couple small glares over to the Kids. 

                                RICHARD (sotto) 
                      Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep lookin'
                      tough-old folks. 

                                STANLEY 
                      They look pretty smart, I think. 

                                JULIA
                      No they don't -- 

                                RICHARD 
                      What are they gonna do -- beat us? 

                                STANLEY
                      Maybe.

                                JULIA 
                      We're not going out two days before 
                      we set the record, it's not gonna happen. 

                                RICHARD
                      When they want us done, they'll call 
                      in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit. 

     CAMERA lands in CU on Stanley.  HOLD. BEAT. THEN: 

                                                                CUT TO: 

     INT. JIMMY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

     Jimmy and a woman named PAULA (3Os) sit in his office. SLOW DOLLY IN
     ON EACH thru scene;

                                JIMMY
                      You look great.

     BEAT. 

                                PAULA 
                      What the fuck is this, Jimmy? 

                                JIMMY
                      ...you know... 

                                PAULA 
                      Did your wife find out? 

                                JIMMY
                      No. 

                                PAULA
                      Then what? 

                                JIMMY 
                      It's just...too late for me to be
                      fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. 
                      I gotta clean my brain of all the 
                      shit I've done that I shouldn't have done -- 

                                PAULA 
                      -- that you shouldn't have done? 
                      That you regret, what? This? What's
                      this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me 
                      like an asshole, but treat me like
                      an asshole. 

                                JIMMY 
                      I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. 
                      I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore. 

     She doesn't respond. BEAT. THEN: 

                                JIMMY 
                      Thirty fuckin' years I've been with
                      Rose, don't -- y'know -- with 
                      this, and I know what you think -- 

                                PAULA 
                      All your other fluzzies? 

                                JIMMY
                      Yeah. Yes. 

                                PAULA
                      You're making me feel so dirty and shitty.
                      I feel like a big piece of shit right now. 

     BEAT. 

                                PAULA 
                      Are you gonna tell her what you've done? 

                                JIMMY
                      Yes. 

                                PAULA 
                      Will you say my name? 

                                JIMMY 
                      If she asks me any question I want
                      to tell her.  I want to tell her
                      everything I've done. 

                                PAULA 
                      Well can you do me one favor and
                      don't do that. 

     Jimmy doesn't answer.

                                PAULA 
                      Come and tell me it's over and I'll
                      walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you
                      behind your wife's back for three 
                      years, and you've fucked teenage girls
                      behind mine for the same amount of 
                      time -- I'll walk away, you need something
                      for your life, for your conscience,
                      but don't put me in the middle -- 

                                JIMMY
                      I won't. 

                                PAULA 
                      What happend to you? 

                                JIMMY 
                      I got in trouble at school. 

     She stands and walks over to him, moves to give him a hug. 

                                PAULA
                      Are you ok? 

                                JIMMY
                      Fuck no. 

     There's a KNOCK at the door and then it's opened by BURT RAMSEY (60s)
     He's the producer of the show; (WHIP TO HIM)

                                BURT

                                PAULA
                      Burt. 

     Jimmy takes a quick shot, moves to Paula, gives her a tap on the
     cheek and says;

                                JIMMY (to Paula)
                      You're a good one arentcha?

     INT. CLAUDIA'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT. **

     Claudia finishes throwing her drugs into a dirty t-shirt and throwing
     that dirty t-shirt into her laundry basket.  Jim Kurring bangs away at
     the door. 

                                JIM KURRING (OC)
                      OPEN THE DOOR. 

                                CLAUDIA
                      I'm coming!

     She runs towards the door, takes a small fall on the way, recovers,
     opens up; 

                                CLAUIDA
                      Yeah. Hi. Hello. 

     REVERSE, CLOSE UP - JIM KURRING - 40fps. 
     CAMERA pushes in on him a little bit at his first sight of Claudia. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      ...yeah...

                      I'm sorry, I had to get dressed. 

     Wider Angle reveals Jim Kurring, in a bit of a daze, standing with 
     his BILLY CLUB removed and at the ready.  He stands back...they have
     SHOUT above the music;

                                JIM KURRING

                      No one else in there with you? 

                                CLAUIDA
                      No, what's wrong? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You mind if I come in, check things? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      For what? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Ok. For one thing, we're gonna 
                      need to turn that music down so
                      we can talk, ok? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      I'm sorry. 

     She turns and Jim Kurring moves to replace his billy club, but misses
     the holster and it FALLS straight to the floor, slides down the steps. 

     Claudia turns the music down, turns back and sees that he is gone.

     Jim Kurring grabs his billy club from the bottom of the steps and
     bounces back up and into the apartment as if nothing happend; 

                                JIM KURRING
                      You live alone? 

                                CLAUIDA
                      Yes. 

                                JIM KURRING

                                CLAUDIA
                      Wilson. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      What? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Did you hear what I said? 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Yeah, but I don't know -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      -- listenin' to that music so loud:
                      You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?

                                CLAUDIA
                      No. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Well if you keep listenin' to the
                      music that loud you're not only
                      gonna damage your ears but your
                      neighbors ears.

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I didn't realize it was that loud. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      And that could be the sign of a damaged
                      ear drum, you understand? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      Yeah. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You got the TV on too, keep those
                      on at that same time usually? 

                                CALUDIA 
                      I don't know -- I mean.  What is this? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Have you been drinkin' today,
                      doin' some drugs? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      No.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I got a call of a disturbance, screaming
                      and yelling, loud music.  Has there been
                      some screaming and yelling? 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Yes.  I had someone come to my door, 
                      someone I didn't want here and I told them
                      to leave -- so -- it's no big deal.
                      They left.  I'm sorry. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Was it a boyfriend of yours?

                                CLAUDIA 
                      No. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You don't have a boyfriend? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      No.

                                JIM KURRING
                      Who was it? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      I was...he's gone...I mean it's not.
                      It's over, y'know -- 

     Jim Kurring snoops a bit, she rubs her nose, nervous.  Jim Kurring
     heads closer to bedroom --

                                JIM KURRING
                      You mind if I check things back here? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      It's fine. 

     Jim Kurring heads into the bedroom, looks around, stands by the 
     laundry basket --

                                CLAUDIA 
                      What are you lookin' for?

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Claudia: Why don't you let me 
                      handle the questions and you handle
                      the answers, ok? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      ok. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      You just move in here?

                      Bit messy. 

                                CLAUDIA

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I'm a bit of a slob myself. 

                                CLAUDIA
                      Yeah. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      You and your boyfriend have a party
                      last night? 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I don't have a boyfriend.

     INT. SMILING PEANUT BAR - THAT MOMENT.

     Donnie sits in his booth after two tequila's.  He's slightly fucked up. 
     He gets up, stumbles over to the bar and takes a seat uncomfortably 
     close to Thurston, who's now holding court among three or four other
     PATRONS.  Brad the Bartender is washing glasses, keeps half an eye on
     things...Donnie to Thurston; 

                                DONNIE 
                      You look like you've got money
                      in your pocket.

                                THURSTON 
                      Maybe I'm just happy to see my
                      friend, Brad there. 

     The PATRONS laugh a bit, Brad nods, Donnie doesn't laugh or look
     anywhere but Thurston; 

                                DONNIE
                      Just throw some money around.
                      Money, money, money. 

                                THURSTON
                      This sounds threatening.

                                DONNIE 
                      Do you have love in your heart? 

                                THURSTON
                      I have love all over.  I even have
                      love for you, friend.

                                DONNIE 
                      Is it real love?

                                THURSTON
                      Well -- 

                                DONNIE
                      -- the kind of love that makes you feel
                      that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach.
                      Like a bucket of acid and nerves running
                      around and making you hurt and happy and
                      all over you're head over heels....? 

                                THURSTON
                      Well you lost me with the last couple
                      of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but 
                      I believe it's that sort of love.
                      Sounds nice to me.

                                DONNIE
                      I have love. 

                                THURSTON 
                      A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.

                                DONNIE 
                      No.  I mean, I'm telling you: 
                      I'm telling you that I have love. 

                                THURSTON
                      And I'm listening avidly, fellow.

                                DONNIE 
                      My name is Donnie Smith and I have
                      lot's of love to give. 

     BEAT.

     INT. SHERMAN OAKS PHARMACY - THAT MOMENT.

     CAMERA pushes in on Linda as she enters, heads to the back for 
     the perscription counter and a YOUNG PHARMACY KID behind the counter;

                      Hello. 

                                LINDA
                      Hi. 

     She hands over her three perscriptions.  The Young Pharmacy Kid takes a
     long look at them, gives her a suspicious glance. 

                                YOUNG PHARMACY KID
                      Wow.  Lot-o-stuff here, huh? 

     Linda nods.  He goes to the back to the old-guy PHARMACIST and says
     a few words, points to Linda.  Another suspicious look or
     two from the both of them...the PHARMACIST guy gets on the phone.

     ANGLE, LINDA. SLOW ZOOM IN. Blend from 24fps to 40fps.
     She just holds her breath and temper, looks down.

                      speed in a pill.  Y'know?  But I guess
                      a lot of doctors are balancing out
                      the prozac with the dexadrine, eh?

                      all that stuff there. 

     The Older Pharamacist DINGS his bell and the Young Pharmacy Kid

     Linda PUSHES a large DISPLAY over on it's side, SMASHES things on the

                      I know -- and I can't really explain that,
                      but I have a feeling there's something, 
                      some situation between them, like they don't 
                      really know each other much or well, something

                      true, because they really happen.

                      I don't how much I went -- but I was
                      enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. 
                      I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat.
                      Not even close to what I am today. 
                      Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk
                      to because I was swimming in what was as
                      opposed to I wanted. 

                                GWEN

                                FRANK 
                      "Frank" was my mother's father. 

                                GWEN 
                      Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating
                      your school records at Berkely and UCLA.
                      Your name change -- they had no official
                      enrollment -- 

                                FRANK 
                      Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't -- 

                                GWEN
                      They wouldn't?

                      no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't
                      officialy enrolled, that's right.
                      Was that unclear? 

                                GWEN
                      Kind of.

                                FRANK
                      I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood:
                      My enrollment was totally unoffical because
                      I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up 
                      there.  But there were three wonderful men
                      who were kind enough to let me sit in on
                      their classes, and they're names are: 
                      Macready, Horn and Langtree among others.
                      I was completely independent financially,
                      and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. 
                      So what we're looking at here is a true
                      rags to riches story and I think that's 
                      what most people respond to in "Seduce,"
                      And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not 
                      even be about picking up chicks and sticking your
                      cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be
                      In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and 
                      saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen 
                      to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck-

     Jimmy opens an ENVELOPE and reads:

                                JIMMY GATOR 
                      Kids in the lead and they get a chance 
                      to pull further and farther ahead -- with
                      the following secret bonus musical question:
                      I will read you a line from an opera
                      and you are to give me the same line
                      in the language in which the opera 
                      was originaly written and for a bonus
                      25 you can sing it.  Here's the line: 
                      "Love is a rebellious bird that nobody 
                       can tame, and it's all in vain to call it,
                       if it chooses to refuse."

     CAMERA PANS and DOLLIES over to the KIDS and moves in close on Stanley;

                                STANELY
                      Well that was..uh..in French...and that
                      was in the opera, "Carmen." And that
                      goes...um... 
                                (sings) 
                      L'amour est un oiseau rebelle
                      Que nul ne peut apprivoiser, 
                      Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle,
                      S'il lui convient de refuser.

     The AUDIENCE applauds and the "Carmen," que carries over the
     following scene;

     INT. CLAUDIA'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT               Sequence E

     Jim Kurring and Clauida continued.  He walks into the KITCHEN area
     and sees a pot of coffee.

                                JIM KURRING 
                      got some coffee brewing, huh? 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I like iced coffee, generally, but a day
                      like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --

                                CLAUDIA 
                      -- do you wanna cup? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      That's great, thank you. 

     She starts heating/preparing him some coffee.

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I don't know how fresh it's gonna be -- 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia. 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      You take cream or sugar? 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say,
                      so I can get my role of LAPD officer
                      out of the way before we enjoy our 
                      coffee (I never like to talk shop over coffee)
                      I'm not gonna write you up or anything,
                      I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- 
                      but the real problem we have is that there
                      are people around here, people that 
                      work from their homes, people tryin' to get
                      some work done, and if you're listenin' to 
                      your music that loud:  They're incovenienced
                      by that.  If you had a job you'd probably
                      understand, but I see you like listenin' 
                      to your music and that's fine, you're just 
                      gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume,
                      maybe memorize what number you see on the
                      dial and just always put it to that -- 
                      If it's the middle of the day -- that's 
                      what I do -- just put it on two and a half 
                      and that's a good listening level, alright? 
                      I see you like listenin' to your music loud,
                      but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you
                      end up damaging your own ears ok? 

                                CLAUDIA
                      Yeah. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Arlight, then.  Cheers. 

     They clink coffee cups.  He makes a sour face at the taste;

                                JIM KURRING
                      Is this boyfriend bothering you? 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I don't have a boyfriend.

                                JIM KURRING
                      The gentleman who came to the door --

                                CLAUDIA 
                      -- is not my boyfriend. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      Many times, in damestic abuse situations
                      the young lady is afraid to speak,
                      but I have to tell you that, being
                      a police officer, I've seen it happen: 
                      Young woman afraid to speak, next thing 
                      you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, 
                      I got a 422 --

                                CLAUDIA
                      It's not -- what's a 422?

                                JIM KURRING 
                      It's where situations like these 
                      lead, Claudia, unless you do something
                      about it early, if and when the police
                      call and come for help.  Now there 
                      are certain measures you can take -- 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      It's not my boyfriend -- and it's
                      not anything -- it's over.  Really.
                      It's not.  He won't came back. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      I don't wanna have to come back here 
                      in an hour and find that there's
                      been another disturbance.

                                CLAUDIA 
                      You won't.  You won't have to. 

                                JIM KURRING 
                      But I wouldn't mind comin' back in 
                      an hour just to see your pretty face!

     They laugh. 

                                CLAUDIA 
                      I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick. 

                                JIM KURRING
                      Okey-doke. 

     She exits.  HOLD A BEAT with him.

                      and you can go then -- Just Hold It.

     Earl is MOANING in pain, the DOGS are barking at the noise. 

     Earl continues to hallucinate and remains in major pain, but at 
     the same time he's very, very weak.  There are moments of strength
     that pop and push into him and he's very angry with Phil, continues
     to scream for someone named, "Lily," and generally treats Phil like
     an enemy.

                                EARL 
                      LILY.  FUCK. LIL, PLEASE. LILY.

     He drops them, the crash on the floor, picks them all up, except one... 

     ...which one of the Mutt Dogs walks over to and eats.  Earl SCREAMS.

     The Mutt/Morphine Dog is starting to get a bit wobbly. 

                                PHIL 
                      Yeah, hey. Chad.

                      you over to Frank's assitant, Janet
                      she's gonna see what she can do -- 

                                PHIL 
                      Thank you, Chad, and good luck
                      to you and your mother --

                      Thank you.  Thank you very much. 

     Chad clicks a line and confrences Janet and Phil.

     She doesn't know what to say.

                      I have about two months, I have no time. 
                      It's in my bones and I don't have a chance.
                      And I'm fucked.  I had a stroke last week --

     to Stanley who watches Jimmy closely and sees him stumble a bit,
     recognizes that something is wrong.  Floor Director counts, 3-2-1 --

                      ....do you know who I am?

                      You're a friend of the family I presume?

                      What?  What does that mean? 

                                THURSTON 
                      Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.

                      Smart Kid!  Fuck, yeah, he-he.  You got

                      So what? 

                                PATRON #1
                      I heard about that.

                      But you're alright now, so what's the what?

                      Brad, dear?

     Brad turns and looks:

                                THURSTON 
                      Who was it that said: "A man of genius 
                      has seldom been ruined but by himself."

                                DONNIE 
                              (to himself)
                      -- Samuel Johnson.

                                BRAD
                      I don't know. 

     Donnie looks up at Brad.  Brad smiles with his braces, Donnie looks
     away quick --

                                THURSTON 
                      It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who 
                      also spoke of a fella "Who was not only 
                      dull but a cause of dullness in others." 

                                DONNIE 
                      "The" cause of dullness in others -- 

                                THURSTON
                      Picky, picky. 

                                DONNIE 
                      -- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson
                      never had his life shit on and taken from
                      him and his money stolen -- who took his
                      life and his money?  His parents? 
                      His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life
                      like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on
                      as a child and that scars and it hurts and 
                      have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts
                      and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an 
                      electrical charge that finds it's way across
                      the universe and lands in your body and your
                      head -- and as for "ruined but by himself,"
                      not if his parents take his friggin' life and 
                      his money and tell you to do this and do that and
                      if you don't? well, what -- 

                                PATRON #1 
                      You're parents took your money you won
                      on that game show? 

                                DONNIE
                      Yes they did. 
                           (turns quick to Thurston) 
                      What does that mean, "spoke in the wheel?" 

                                THURSTON 
                      Things go round 'n round, don't they? 

                                DONNIE 
                      Yes they do, they do, but I'll make 
                      my dreams come true, you see?  I will.

                                THURSTON 
                      This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow. 

                                DONNIE 
                      I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid. 

                                THURSTON 
                      Shall we drink to that?

     Donnie looks to the television for a moment, starts to tear up, 
     CAMERA pushes in slow to an EXTREME CLOSE UP.  He repeats line's from
     his days on "What Do Kids Know?" and does his best Jimmy immitation;

                      "If a brick weighs one pound plus one 
                      half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?"
                      "Well if subtracting the half of brick from
                      the whole brick you got one half of brick,
                      equals one pound so therefore the brick 
                      equals two pounds --" "A little more than

     Frank and Gwenovier doing the telvision interview. CAMERA DOLLIES
     IN SLOW ON EACH:

                                FRANK 
                      -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M 
                      saying, that none of my competitors can say is
                      this:  That there is no need for insight or
                      understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done.
                      Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is?
                      How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and
                      ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm 
                      talking about eliminating insight and understanding
                      as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is
                      no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for
                      UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take 
                      any subjective human experience -- in other
                      words -- all the terrible shit or all the 
                      great shit that you've had happen to you in 
                      your life -- and quickly and easily transform
                      it in the unconscious mind through the subtle 
                      and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"
                      (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very
                      light, very delicate, conversationally induced
                      state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. 
                      A state that is brand new.  The System's state.
                      What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put 
                      it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use.
                      I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the 
                      seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 
                      'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that
                      will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- 

                                GWENOVIER
                      Let's talk about -- 

                                FRANK 
                      I just realized this is for television,
                      isn't it?  I can't swear up and down
                      like I just did. 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      It's fine.  I can bleep it out. 

                                FRANK 
                      I warned you -- I get on a roll... 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      -- let's talk more about your background -- 

                                FRANK
                      Muffy -- coffee? 

     Muffy moves to pour a cup, Gwen looks down at her clipboard, then:

                                GWENOVIER 
                      I'm confused about your past is the thing. 

                                FRANK 
                      Is that still lingering? 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      -- just to clarify -- 

                                FRANK
                      So boring, so useless -- 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      I would just want to clear some things up: 

                                FRANK 
                           (Muffy delivers coffee) 
                      Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is:
                      This is an important element of,
                      "Seduce and Destory:"
                      "Facing the past is an important way 
                      in not making progress," that's something
                      I tell my men over and over -- 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      This isn't meant -- 

                                FRANK 
                      -- and I try and teach the students to
                      ask: What is it in aid of? 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      Are you asking me that?

                                FRANK
                      Yes. 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      Well, just trying to figure out who you are,
                      and how you might have become -- 

                                FRANK
                      In aid of what?

                                GWENOVIER 
                      I'm saying, Frank, in trying to
                      figure out who you are -- 

                                FRANK 
                      -- there's a lot more important things
                      I'd like to put myself into -- 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      It's all important -- 

                                FRANK
                      Not really. 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      It's not like I'm trying to attack you -- 

                                FRANK 
                      This is how you wanna spend the time,
                      then go, go, go -- you're gonna 
                      be surprised at what a waste it is --
                      "The most useless thing in the world 
                      is that which is behind me," Chapter Three -- 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      We talked earlier about your mother. 
                      And we talked about your father and his death.
                      And I don't want to be challenging or
                      defeatist here, but I have to ask and 
                      I would want to clarify something --
                      something that I understand -- 

                                FRANK 
                      I'm not sure I hear a question in there? 

                                GWENOVIER
                      Do you remember a Miss Simms? 

                                FRANK 
                      I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.

                                GWENOVIER 
                      She does.  From when you were a boy. 

                                FRANK
                      Mm. Hm. 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      She lived in Tarzana. 

                                FRANK 
                      An old stomping ground --is this 
                      the "attack" portion of the interview,
                      I figured this was coming sooner 
                      or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill? 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      No, this is about getting something 
                      right and claryfying one of your answers
                      to an earlier question -- 

                                FRANK 
                      Go ahead and waste your time.

                                GWENOVIER 
                      I was told that your mother died.
                      That your mother died when you were young -- 

                                FRANK 
                      And that's what you've heard? 

                                GWENOVIER 
                      I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms
                      was your caretaker and neighbor
                      after your mother died in 1980.

     BEAT. Frank goes silent.

                                GWENOVIER 
                      In my research I have you listed as 
                      the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge.
                                (beat)
                      And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that
                      your mother passed away in 1980. 
                                (beat) 
                      See:  It's my understanding that the information
                      supplied by you and your company and answers 
                      to question's I've asked are incorrect, Frank.
                      And if I'd like to get to the bottom of who you
                      are and why you are then I think your family 
                      history -- you're accurate family history...well:
                      this seems important...Frank...?

     Frank lights his cigarette.  CAMERA zooms into CU.

                                FRANK 
                      Are you asking me a question?

                                GWEN
                      Well I guess the question is this:
                      Do you remember Miss Simms? 

     BEAT. HOLD, THEN:

                      Kids, Adults, I'd like you to put
                      yourself at a picnic.  Place yourself
                      there with your family and friends
                      if you'd like -- you'll hear three
                      musical notes and you are to tell me
                      what it might represent that you'd
                      find at a picnic -- The First Three Notes:

     OC we hear three musical notes.  The "Adults" panel lights up,
     Todd answers;

                                TODD
                      Well, Jimmy, I know this, I have perfect
                      pitch, you see -- and that would be A-D-E.
                      And that would represent lemonade.

                                JIMMY
                      For 250.  Next notes, please:

     OC musical notes: E-G-G.

                                TODD (buzzes)
                      Got it.  That's E-G-G which would be ~egg."

     Richard and Julia glance at Stanley, like "why the fuck aren't you
     answering these questions?" He looks straight ahead. 

                                JIMMY

                      I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't 
                      know...there's so much...so many things --

                      Are you on drugs right now? 

                                LINDA 
                      If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell 
                      you things...then you're a lawyer, right? 
                      You can't say things, you can't tell anyone,
                      it's like the privelage, right?

                      Like a shrink, like if I go to see
                      a shrink, I'm protected, I can say

                      You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients

                      No, no....no, you see...I never loved him.
                      I never loved him, Earl.  When I started,
                      when I met him, I met him and I fucked
                      him and I married him because I wanted
                      his money, do you understand?

                      I'm telling you this now...this I've never

                      And now....I know I'm in that will,
                      I know, I was there with him, we were
                      all there together when we made that
                      fucking thing and all the money I'II 
                      get -- I don't want it -- Because I love
                      him so much now...I've fallen in love 
                      with him now, for real, as he's dying, 
                      and I look at him and he's about to
                      go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments... 
                                (beat)

                      "Hello, Mary.  How are you and the 
                      seven kids?  As you probably heard by 
                      know, we sure gave that Pope a run for
                      his money --"

     to another question that is spoken by the OC voice -- this
     time in French;

                                VOICE (in French)
                      "Hello, Josephine, 
                      I'm speaking from Egypt --" 

     The Adults buzz again and Mim answers;

                                JIMMY
                      Mim --

                                MIM
                      Well that would be Napoleon speaking
                      to Josephine. 

                                JIMMY
                      That's right!

     ANGLE, BURT.  He stands off, looking at the scoreboard as the
     Adults have now pulled ahead by 200 points...he mumbles and
     grumbles to himself.

                                                                CUT TO:

     INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

     Linda continued with the lawyer, Kligman.

                                LINDA
                      I don't want him to die, I didn't love him 
                      when we met, and I've done so many bad things
                      to him that he doesn't know, things I want 
                      to confess to him, but now I do: I love him.
                      I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going. 

                                KLIGMAN 
                      What kind of medication are 
                      you on right now, Linda that's -- 

                                LINDA 
                      This is not any fucking medication 
                      talking, this isn't -- I don't know. 
                      I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? 
                      You have power of attorney, can you see him, 
                      can you, in this final fucking moment, go see
                      him and make sure --- change the fucking 
                      will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't
                      live with myself, this thing I've done --
                      I've fucking done so many bad things -- 
                      I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, 
                      I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer,
                      our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married.
                      I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking
                      cheated on him, many times over, I sucked 
                      other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - 
                           ....fuck....
                      Other Things I've Done..

                                KLIGMAN 
                      Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something
                      that can be used in a court to discredit
                      the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down. 

                                LINDA
                      I can't. 

                                KLIGMAN 
                      You don't have to change the will, 
                      if what you want to do is get nothing
                      you can renounce the will when it's time.

                                LINDA 
                      Where will the money go? 

                                KLIGMAN 
                      Well.  Considering that there's no one 
                      else mentioned in the will...we'd
                      have to go to the laws of intestacy, 
                      which is -- as if someone died without a
