			TALK SHOW HOST (V.O.)
	And we're back with "Interpreting

	have Allen in Hollywood on line...
	12. Hello Allen...are you there? 
	Hello..?

ALLEN has the TALK SHOW HOST on hold so he doesn't 
hear her.


			ALLEN
	Okay...hold on. Yeah I'll take care of 
	you in a second...I'm transferring 
	you over..

			TALK SHOW HOST
	We are live on the air....Hello...?

			ALLEN
	Hello.? Yeah okay I've got somebody else 
	on hold...I'm going to transfer you 
	over. It might be a second, just hold on.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	(aside) I'm on hold..

EXTERIOR - THE BIG ISLAND FROM ABOVE - DAY
The Big Island floats in sparkling light. WE HEAR a 
radio show filtered through the small speaker of an 
old radio.

	Okay, we're going to have to go...
	
			ALLEN
	Okay, oh doctor.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Hello?

The Ranch House stands isolated in a dry island 
valley. The plane passes overhead.


			TALK SHOW HOST
	You're live on the air.

INSERT VIEW on RADIO. We HEAR

			ALLEN
	Can I use my real name on the radio?

INTERIOR - RANCH HOUSE - DAY
MARIE-NOEL is sitting in front of a mirror putting 
on her makeup. She is listening to the broadcast. 
She pays attention to ALLEN's dream when he says the 
word "invisible".

The TALK SHOW HOST speaks flatly, angrily.


			TALK SHOW HOST
	What is your dream?

			ALLEN
	First of all I'm invisible. I see 
	myself looking in a mirror. I'm 
	having this dream almost every night.

MARIE-NOEL listens more carefully to the radio.


			TALK SHOW HOST
	Yes?

VIEW ON: A Sparkling lake. 

VIEW ON: MARIE-NOEL throwing bouquet at her wedding.


			ALLEN
	And the next thing you know I'm 
	getting married. I don't know to 
	whom....

INTERIOR - RANCH HOUSE - DAY
MARIE-NOEL looks in the mirror again; the 
conversation on the radio affirms something she 
knows to be true.


			TALK SHOW HOST
	And how long have you been having 
	this dream?

			ALLEN
	Like an entire solid month.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Uh huh...

EXTERIOR - LA HARBOR - DAY
A truck wipes the frame and we see MARIE-NOEL 
walking along the highway at a leisurely pace.


			ALLEN
	Then all of a sudden I see myself 
	walking down a road by the harbor....

The TALK SHOW HOST interrupts. WE HEAR a telephone 
ring.


			TALK SHOW HOST
	And how do you feel at this point 
	in the dream?

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
TONY, having been stopped by the truck, cuts down a 
side street to get around the gridlock. We HEAR 
ALLEN's phone RING.


			ALLEN
	Can you hold on for one second...
	Hello.  

			TALK SHOW HOST
	No, actually we can't...Hello?

INTERIOR - OFFICE - DAY
ALLEN is trying to juggle too many things at once. 
He tries to transfer incoming calls without losing 
them. He has the TALK SHOW HOST on hold again.


			ALLEN
	Yeah, I've got two other lines. 
	Can you hold a second? Great....

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Hello! Allen from Hollywood!

			ALLEN
	Hello...yeah...hold on. I can 
	transfer you now.

EXTERIOR - HARBOR - DAY
A MAN fixes the tire of an old Mercedes as MARIE-
NOEL walks into frame. MARIE-NOEL stoops down and 
looks at his face. The man has no awareness of her. 
She is invisible.


			TALK SHOW HOST
	Are you there? Hello?

			ALLEN
	Hi. Hi. Sorry.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Allen we don't have the time....

			ALLEN
	Sorry..

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Allen we're on the air and you 
	can not put me on hold.

			ALLEN
	I'm really sorry....

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Go on with your dream Allen.

			ALLEN
	Am I on?

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Yes.

			ALLEN
	Okay. I'm walking along the road down 
	by the harbor, and I'm invisible, and 
	I go around looking at people knowing 
	that they can't even see me and in 
	this dream.....

INTERIOR - CAR - DAY
MARIE-NOEL is now in the car with the driver who 
fixed the flat. The driver cannot see her and MARIE-
NOEL flicks his ear to tease him and test her 
invisibility.


			ALLEN
	... I ride around with people. I get 
	in their cars, I go all over town.

INTERIOR - OFFICE - DAY
ALLEN has risen to a peak in energy.


			ALLEN
	I mean here...this, this, this.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	And how does it feel to you?

VIEW on PHONE: WE HEAR a RING
		
			ALLEN
	Can you hold on a second?

NOTE: DISCONTINUITY - Glasses disappear from 
ALLEN's Hand.

VIEW ON ALLEN
He turns to a colleague in the office while the TALK 
SHOW HOST languishes on hold.
		

			ALLEN
	I've got two juice commercials. I'm 
	like the spokesman for the company now. 
	I got a Baske and Robbins, and I'm on 
	avail for a couple of beer things that 
	are going on..

WE HEAR another RING. A hand in the foreground 
picks up a phone. ALLEN goes back to the line of 
the TALK SHOW HOST.


			COLLEAGUE
	Hello...

			ALLEN
	Dr. Powell I'm back....

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
TONY continues his shortcut around the gridlock. His
car passes camera in a suburban neighborhood.


			TALK SHOW HOST
	I think we're running out of time 
	here Allen.

			ALLEN
	Sorry to put you on hold....You 
	see then I get out of the car... 

EXTERIOR - LA - EVENING
ALLEN walks from his job to his car.

		
			ALLEN
	...and I walk all day...

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
MARIE-NOEL walks down Hollywood Blvd. Creatures of 
the night surround her.


			ALLEN
	...and all night.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Don't put me on hold...

EXTERIOR - LA - NIGHT
ALLEN walking on a back street.


			ALLEN
	No, no, no, no. I'm at work. I'm at work. 

			TALK SHOW HOST
	Is this a real call?

			ALLEN
	What do you think? Do you think I'd 
	make a fake call in the middle of work?

EXTERIOR - SIDE STREET LA - NIGHT
TONY turns the corner and heads back to Melrose 
toward a point beyond the gridlock.


			TALK SHOW HOST	
	I'm feeling very left out here because 
	you're not telling me how you feel.  
	I'm telling you....

EXTERIOR - MELROSE BLVD.- NIGHT
MARIE-NOEL walks toward camera as ALLEN enters frame
on the left. ALLEN and MARIE-NOEL pass at the corner. 
Neither notices the other. TONY pulls into the frame
at the intersection and MARIE-NOEL sees TONY who 
does not notice either ALLEN or MARIE-NOEL. MARIE-
NOEL runs to TONY'S convertible car and jumps in the
back. She rides joyfully as TONY speeds off.


			ALLEN
	And then this really strange thing 
	happens.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	What do you do for a living?

			ALLEN
	While I'm walking...I'm an Actor...
	
			TALK SHOW HOST
	So in other words you are in limbo in 
	your daily life.
				
			ALLEN
	I'm walking, and I see myself walking, 
	but I don't stop, I just keep on walking.

			TALK SHOW HOST
	You must be feeling invisible in your 
	daily life and it's coming out in your 
	dreams.

			ALLEN
	I want to know what you think about the 
	dream, let me finish it! Can you hold on 
	a second please?

			TALK SHOW HOST
	You can not put me on hold....I'm sorry 
	but we're going to have to go to Mike 
	in Downey on line 13.  Thank you very much 
	for calling.


TITLE: "START HERE"

EXTERIOR - LA - SUNRISE
We see a distant mountain silhouetted against the

plane is visible as a speck in the frame and flies 
close to the mountain. The sun rises to the opening 
cadence of:

MUSIC: MOZART SYMPHONY 34 #1

The plane grows more faint as the sun continues to 
rise.

sit on top of it, resting, waiting, then they 
interrupt each other.

	Let's not.

			MARIE-NOEL
	Let's not. Sorry.

			TONY
	We'll just go home and we'll wait it out.

	This place stinks!

MARIE-NOEL stands up and moves to the other side of 
the bench, her back towards TONY.

through the unopened doors. BRENDA looks murderous 
in her wild hair and hot pants.

INTERIOR - HALLOWEEN PARTY
TONY and MARIE-NOEL wander separately around the 
party as costumed hipsters sway with the music. TWO 
WOMEN react in horror as something unseen occurs 
which causes the crowd to panic. A SHEEP is left 
standing in the empty hall.

TITLE: "ACTOR CREDIT"

EXTERIOR - BENCH IN SAME PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL both scratch their ears at the 
same time. A faint sound of thunder causes TONY to 
look into the distance. They interrupt each other 
again.


			TONY
	Let's not.

			MARIE-NOEL
	You know.....You know, at this point I'm 
	blaming it all on bad karma. This is how
	we die, man. I wish they'd just get it 
	over with.

MUSIC STARTS


			TONY
	Don't give up. I mean nothing has happened 
	to us. She'll probably be at the boat waiting 
	for us when we get there.

EXTERIOR - ADJACENT STREET - SUNRISE
BRENDA fast walks on a street next to the park.  As 
she approaches, she suddenly stops. WE HEAR the 
sound of rain. It is a clear morning.  Perplexed, 
she laughs. 

EXTERIOR - PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL walk urgently through a wooded 
section of the park. The sound of thunder gets 
louder and louder getting closer to them. TONY grabs
MARIE-NOEL'S arm as the fearful sound passes close 
to them without incident.

EXTERIOR - ADJACENT STREET - SUNRISE
BRENDA walks past the camera, still perplexed by the
odd occurrence.  

EXTERIOR - LA - SUNRISE
We see the mountain again and continue to HEAR the 
airplane.

EXTERIOR - WEST LOS ANGELES - SUNRISE
The fog is coming in. Tops of buildings disappear.

	Let's not be naive about the earthquake...

EXTERIOR - CENTURY CITY FROM THE AIR - SUNRISE

The sun rises above them.

EXTERIOR - PARK - SUNRISE
TONY and MARIE-NOEL continue to walk urgently 
through a wooded section of the park.

	Let me tell you, I had a premonition. I had 
	the worst feeling when she said she was going 
	to go up and see the band.

EXTERIOR - PARK - DAY
TONY and MARIE-NOEL walk along, totally engulfed in 
fog. 

			MARIE-NOEL
	What if we get it for not warning her?

THEIR POV
We see a sheep standing beside a tree in the fog.

EXTERIOR - PARK - MORNING 
Through a fog we see a sheep standing next to a tree. 
MARIE-NOEL and TONY arrive at the tree. They are 
horrified. 

INTERIOR - ALLEN'S BEDROOM - MORNING
ALLEN's phone rings. He wakes suddenly and sits up 
in bed; his answering machine goes on. 

We HEAR MUSIC: "Be My Baby" 
coming from a source outside of the bedroom.


			ALLEN'S VOICE
	Hi this is ALLEN at 969-8895. I'm not 
	home right now but if you want to leave 
	me a message I'll get back to you as soon 
	as you can...

ALLEN listens for a minute. He is not quite awake.

TITLE: "Actor Credit"
 
ALLEN gets up and walks to the mirror waiting for 
his long message to end. He looks melodramatically 
at his face. We HEAR THUNDER.  He pulls at his face.
He sits back down on his bed waiting to see if 
someone is on the line.


			ALLEN'S VOICE
	If it's important and during the day you 
	can call me at Knapp Communications. The 
	number is (213) 932-1465. Uh, I should be 
	there all day. And if it's not important 
	and you don't want to call me there leave 
	a message on this machine but don't hang 
	up I really hate that and, uh,that's it, bye.

We HEAR a BEEP but no one is on the line. ALLEN's 
head hits the pillow and he flashes to.

Clip of Scorcese's Mean Streets. Where Keitel's head
hits the pillow.

ALLEN walking satisfied.
                                             
SCENE FROM ALLEN's Pizza commercial, elbows out.

EXTERIOR - STREET IN FRONT OF ALAN'S APARTMENT
Camera dollies past a pickup truck.  The back of the
truck is filled with shopping carts.  A man is 
loading shopping carts into the truck. As the camera 
reaches the door of the truck we hear the source of 
the loud music. We see EUGENE, a homeless man, who 
has his hand out to the driver of the truck. The 
truck pulls away and EUGENE looks around in 
confusion. We HEAR THUNDER. EUGENE looks at ALLEN's 
building.

SCENE FROM ALLEN's deodorant commercial, elbows in.

Off Screen. ALLEN and AUGUST (as ARTEMIS) walk into living room. AUGUST leads the way in, glances into the bedroom on the left.
			ALLEN
	Look around. It's a 1 bedroom, 1/2 bath 
	in the hall and full vanity...laundry 	
	downstairs. 

			AUGUST 
	Is it quiet? 

			ALLEN
	Very quiet. Where you from? 

August stops in left of frame, turns to ALLEN.


			AUGUST 
	Nashville.
	
			ALLEN	
	First time in LA? 

			AUGUST 
	Yeah, I just got a "Seventeen" cover and 
	everyone said I should come here. 

			ALLEN 
	Where are you staying? 

			AUGUST 
	With my Aunt. 

			ALLEN
	Do you act? 

August approaches the camera. She is wearing 1/2 
moon earrings.


			AUGUST 
	No, just modeling for now. But I've heard about 
	some really great workshops from my agent. 

AUGUST feels satisfied with what she sees as she 
gazes into the bedroom. ALLEN draws closer.
 
			ALLEN 
	I'm an actor. TV commercials, some stage. 
	I know just about everybody in town, free 
	advice, comes with the rent. 

			AUGUST. 
	How much is it? 

			ALLEN 
	Well, the first month's free. You've got 
	to come up with some kind of security deposit, 
	figure one month and then the last month 
	and that comes to half the price published 
	in the ad.

			AUGUST. 
	(No response)

			ALLEN 
	Does that seem like a lot? 

			AUGUST 
	Well for Tennessee standards, but I don't know. 

			ALLEN 
	Do you know why the apartment's only half per 
	month of the going rate for this size apartment 
	in Hollywood? 

			AUGUST.
	No. 

			ALLEN 
	Because I sleep here 1 night a week. 

AUGUST looks at the bedroom, looks in, shocked by 
what she has just heard. She seems confused for a 
moment. She turns and faces ALLEN. ALLEN stares at 
her while blocking the doorway.  She hesitates and 
makes him budge.  ALLEN backs off and August slowly 
walks out of the apartment.  ALLEN is left standing 
alone in the empty apartment.

man is on the phone...


			VOICE
 	TONY, are you there, Tony! Tony! Tony!

...and find TONY at the door looking at the coin. It 
indicates he should go into a Barber shop. TONY 
looks inside the Barber shop and sees threatening 
faces. He enters anyway. Goes up to GUY SELLING SODA
who takes the coin out of TONY's hand and gives him
a soda. TONY is puzzled.

DISSOLVE:

Tony is siting in a chair with a cloth wrapped up to
his neck. The barber looks at TONY'S hair. TONY is 
trying to open the can but can't figure it out.
			

			TONY
	Do you have a church key?
 
Everybody in the barbershop laughs. The barber opens
the soda for him.


			BARBER
	What will it be?

			TONY
	I'll......

Thugs slowly get up from their chairs, dropping 
their magazines, surrounding TONY. 


			GUYS
	Yeah, what'll it be man?

TONY looks around at the 8 mean faces around him.
 

			TONY
	I want to cure my passive aggressive 
	personality.  From now on when I want 
	something I'm going to ask for it. 
	I'm going to learn how to be more 
	observant of signs and consider how 
	other people might need clearer signals 
	from me. 

			GUY 1
	Why don't you get a job. That's what 
	the man says....

			GUY 2
	...You look good, you'd do great in 
	an interview.

			GUY 1
	Join a group. Do something for other 
	people.

			GUY 3
	Go up and talk to people. See if you 
	have someone in common...

			GUY 4
	Do some charity work...
		
 			ALL
	Mingle..Be creative. Take chances. 
	Take ownership.

			GUY 3
	Ride the bus....

INTERIOR - OFFICE - DAY
A woman sits in the shadows of a government welfare 
office.


			BRENDA
	This case is a mess. We don't know what is 
	going on with the child. No, no, no, no,
 	no no, the couple is stonewalling. Nobody has 
	seen the child, in what, 15 years. 
	Every visit is marked "guardian unavailable". 	
	Nobody bothers because it's the island. And 
	get this, the couple, they're not married. No.
	They're the step-children of the owner of 
	the island who is now deceased...	

EXTERIOR - CATALINA EXPRESS TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING
BRENDA walks into the terminal.


			BRENDA (continuing)
	...I have a sniff writ and I'm going out 	
	there next week.

INTERIOR - ISLAND OFFICE - DAY
DAVE, an opposing Attorney, and TOSHI, his assistant,
meet across the table with TONY and his attorney 
DOOLITTLE.


			DOOLITTLE
	The is your meeting so why don't we get down 
	to business. 

			DAVE
	Sounds fine.

			DOOLITTLE
	Call Boston if you want. I don't think the 
	time change will make any difference

Nervous looks among lawyers. TONY is oblivious.


			DAVE
	Your name is Filmore West, correct?

TONY does not answer.


			DOOLITTLE
	We're requesting an environmental impact study 
	on the employment angle in Avalon. 

			DAVE
	Are you kidding?  Any loss in jobs will be 
	absorbed in the Federal tourism franchise. 
	Employment will double, property and leases 
	will increase in value. The overall benefit 
	will be stunning to the average citizen of 
	Avalon.

			DOOLITTLE
	What if we tell everybody about the national 	
	resources here. If you'll remember your history 	
	gentlemen, the civil war was won by the 
	collateral in the Treasury created by the 
	California gold rush. We think the government
	needs a big hit of cash right now to cure the 
	deficit. Remember what Churchill said, a great 
	government never has to face the truth nor pay 
	cash. 

			DAVE
	Could we have a moment?

DOOLITTLE and TOSHI stand and walk from the table.

EXTERIOR - AVALON DOCK - DAYBRENDA storms off the 
boat.

MUSIC: Mendolshon: Symphony #4 in A, Op. 90 
(Italian) 


			DOOLITTLE
	We're looking very good here. Just don't give 
	them anything they can use. Do not say anything.

INTERIOR - ISLAND OFFICE - DAY
DAVE and TOSHI stand and walk to the corner of the 
room.


				DAVE
	What if we bring up the legality of him
	impersonating his grandfather. 

			TOSHI
	I think we need something stronger. Any 
	sexual harassment suits or child abuse. 
	He's a guardian.

EXTERIOR - AVALON INFORMATION BOOTH - DAY
BRENDA enters frame and speaks with an OFFICER.


			BRENDA
	Hello, I'm from the department of Human 
	Services in LA.  I'm looking for a missing 
	child who may be somewhere on the island.

			SHERIDAN
	Name?
	
			BRENDA
	A Marie-Christine West? Her guardian is a
 	Mr. Filmore West.

INTERIOR - INN ON MT. ADA - DAY		
TONY and DOOLITTLE as they confer.

		
			TONY
	I think I know what's going on here.

			DOOLITTLE
	Good, good, good, good, just don't say anything.

EXTERIOR - AVALON INFORMATION BOOTH - DAY
BRENDA continues to speak with the OFFICER.


			BRENDA
	Did they have a child with them? Or did they 
	take this child with them?

The OFFICER interrupts BRENDA.


			OFFICER
	They're brats. They're very unpopular 	
	around here. They're keeping the property 	
	values from tripling.

			BRENDA
	Great, where can I find them?

			SHERIDAN
	Probably France. What would you do if you 	
	owned all of Catalina and Anacapa..?

EXTERIOR - AVALON - DAY
BRENDA walks, somewhat dazed, past the store fronts 
of AVALON.


			OFFICER
	...all the way to San Miguel including 	
	the Big Island which has gold deposits 
	and the IRS are looking for them?

BRENDA's expression changes. She becomes maniacal.

INTERIOR - INN ON MT. ADA - DAY
DAVE and TOSHI sit down again, ready with a response.


			DOOLITTLE	
	Don't say anything.

OPPOSING ATTORNEY hands TONY the documents.


			DAVE
	I'd like to direct your attention to the 	
	signatures on these documents.

DOOLITTLE rips the document out of DAVE'S hand. 


 			DOOLITTLE
	This is intolerable!

			DAVE
	One is a reconveyence of a second deed of 	
	trust, and the other is your recent letter 
	to us. You would have been 4 years old at 
	the time of the first document.

WE HEAR the sound of a small earthquake. ALL PARTIES
loo up and around and it stops.

EXTERIOR - AVALON - DAY
BRENDA is alarmed at the earthquake. She spins, 
disoriented.

INTERIOR - INN ON MT. ADA - DAY
TONY has a knowing look on his face. The earthquake 
is a good sign.


			TONY
	You guys believe in fairy tales don't you?

			DAVE
	We want to know who you are.

			TONY
	This reminds me of the Tempest where the 
	rightful Duke is robbed of his kingdom by 
	his evil brother... 

			TOSHI
	Were you born in this country?

			TONY
	...and the evil brother puts the good Duke 
	and his daughter out to sea in a small boat 
	to die. And at the end of the story....

			DOOLITTLE
	My client is using a figure of speech.

			DAVE
	Then where are we going with this, guys?

			TONY
	You two are going to jail.

			DOOLITTLE
	We're saying....you don't have enough money.

TONY turns to TOSHI.


			TONY
	What do you say next?

			TOSHI
	We're just representing the United States 	
	Government in an attempt to take what the 
	people have a right to.

			TONY
	Big Brother. Orwell! No, no, That's too recent.

			DOOLITTLE
	The situation is irreversible.

DOOLITTLE tries to keep TONY from standing up.


			DAVE
	What are you going to do?  Act it out for us.

TONY heats up.


			TONY
	...And it's raining and hailing and lightning's 	
	striking and you guys think that I'm dead, but 
	I'm not. I'm really back in the big island with 
	my daughter. 

DOOLITTLE puts his hand on TONY'S shoulder to 
restrain him.


			TONY
	And you know what we're doing. Playing chess, 
	and having a picnic!

TONY stands up to leave and crashes into a waiter 
who trips and spills dishes on the floor.
